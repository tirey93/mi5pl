67)  GUYBRUSH
[screaming]MANATEEEEEEE!!!!!!
68)  
As you may recall, Guybrush and his entire ship were swallowed whole... by a giant MANATEE!
69)  
Once back on her feet, Morgan begrudgingly agreed to pose as Guybrush's wife, but De Cava had his own methods of testing that likely story...
70)  
He tried to revive his nemesis, Morgan LeFlay, to pose as his wife, but would need some strong smelling stuff to bring her around.
71)  
Hoping to get back on course to La Esponja Grande, Guybrush set out to fix the manatee's mysteriously missing cochlea.  In the belly of the beast, he met De Cava's long lost crew.  They seemed well aware of the problem, but had no intention of helping Guybrush because he hadn't been voted into their Brotherhood.
72)  
He hornswoggled Noogie for a vote by setting him up on a memorable "date" with Morgan.
73)  
Guybrush and company finally arrived at the home of La Esponja Grande, hidden far below the surface of the ocean.

[Holding GB at sword point, little shaken from the ship's ingestion]{Fierce} Guybrush, I'm taking you in.
94)  GUYBRUSH
[Nervous, looking for an escape]{Scared} I'm sorry, I'm inside a manatee at the moment.
95)  GUYBRUSH
[Sword to throat reaction] Ehh.....
96)  GUYBRUSH
[Sees a ship's boom flying towards Morgan's head]{Surprised} Look behind you -- [cut off]
97)  MORGAN
[Cutting Guybrush off]{serious} Oh, I've heard that one before.
98)  WINSLOW
{Happy} Well done, sir!  Walked the bonnie bounty huntress right into a trap!
99)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} You have to admire her stick-to-it-iveness.
100)  WINSLOW
{Suspicious} She's out cold.
101)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Good. We need to get back on the track to finding La Esponja Grande.  I'm going to go find a way out of here. {Incredulous} Preferably through the front door.  {Embarrassed} Not the... ahem.  Service entrance.
102)  WINSLOW
{happy} I'll keep an eye on Miss LeFlay.{Angry}  If she stirs, I'll give her the old scurvy buttons!
103)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} I don't want to know what that is.
104)  GUYBRUSH
[Approaching De Cava]{Embarrassed}  Um, hello?  Excuse me?
105)  DECAVA
[Startled]{Surprised}  What is this?!  An adventurer from the outside!
106)  GUYBRUSH
[In unison with De Cava] {Confused} Who are you?
107)  DECAVA
[In unison with Guybrush]{Confused} Who are you?
108)  GUYBRUSH
[In unison with De Cava] {Proud} I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate.
109)  DECAVA
[In unison with Guybrush] I'm Coronado De Cava, Mighty Explorer.
110)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} De Cava! I've been looking for you!
111)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What are you doing in here?
112)  DECAVA
{Cocky} I'm on my way to a very important artifact, to be acquired for a VERY important woman.
113)  GUYBRUSH
{Enthused} I hate to be the one to break this to you, but you're stuck inside of an overgrown sea mammal.  You're not on your way anywhere.
114)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} Heavens no!  I'm not stuck!{Happy}  Quite the contrary!  It's all part of the plan of the Ocean Gods!{Enthused}  The mouth of the manatee leads me to the artifact, the seahorses led the mouth to me.
115)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} And when is that? I'm on a bit of a timetable.
116)  DECAVA
{Surprised} When we arrive at the sacred manatee mating grounds!
117)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Oh boy.
118)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} You made a lock picking kit out of toenails?
119)  DECAVA
{Happy} That's right.
120)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} You didn't try the tempt the guard-dog with the bone trick?
121)  DECAVA
Bah, that's for amateurs.
123)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused}How long have you been in here?
124)  DECAVA
{Surprised} Years!  This journey has been even longer than expected.  But exploration is fraught with unforeseen hurdles yearning to be overcome!
125)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} So, I have this locket I'm supposed to give to you.
126)  DECAVA
[Almost speechless] {Surprised} My...oh my... I haven't seen this locket for some years.  She's just as I remember.  [Notices something new about the locket]  Where did you--[cut off]
127)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} What is this?
128)  VOODOOLADYDECAVA
[Speaking through De Cava's body] Threepwood, it is I.
129)  GUYBRUSH
[Scared] {worried}Yikes!
130)  VOODOOLADYDECAVA
[Speaking through De Cava's body] Well done.  You have found Coronado De Cava and are one step closer to La Esponja Grande. De Cava and his crew will prove indispensable on your quest.
131)  DECAVA
[Irate, demanding answers]  Where did you get this?!  Who sent you?!  What are you doing here?!
132)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Look, the Voodoo Lady gave me the locket so I could find La Esponja Grande--
133)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Huh?
134)  DECAVA
La Esponja is to be mine to give to her, as a gargantuan, absorbent symbol of MY fiery passion! I'm gone for two seconds and she's making time with a pre-pubescent picaroon!
135)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} No! It's not like that! [Thinking to himself]  Yeesh, no way. We're hardly even friends.
136)  DECAVA
RIGHT.  A FRIEND who she gives an invaluable, sentimental locket.{Sarcastic} I bet she never sends you on any QUESTS either.
137)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uh, no!  {Confused} I mean, from time to time she tells me what to do and where to go with little or no context, but--
138)  DECAVA
{Angry} That sounds like a quest!
139)  DECAVA
[Quickly shifting gears from angry to sad. Sad now] She used to give ME quests.
140)  DECAVA
{Worried} I thought I was special... Has she ever made you a voodoo doll?
141)  DECAVA
I don't believe you. [Quiet and serious]{Stern} Have you held her in your arms?
142)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} What?! NO! I'm married! Look!
143)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} Ah! I left it with my other hand!
144)  DECAVA
[seriously menacing] I'll kill you.
145)  DECAVA
Then why are you here?
146)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Um...vacation?
147)  DECAVA
[Incredulous]{Suspicious} Is that so.
148)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Yes! [Developing an idea] Honeymooning, in fact!
149)  DECAVA
With your invisible wife?
150)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} My very REAL wife!  Let me just...go...get her.
151)  
The Voodoo Lady gave me the locket!
152)  DECAVA
{Surprised}She WHAT?!?{Angry}  Mi Dio! That two timing, sooth-saying, strumpet!
153)  GUYBRUSH
[Lying]{Incredulous} Nooooo...
154)  
I'm here to retrieve La Esponja Grande!
155)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} I uh... I uh... [Completely spills the beans, breaking under the pressure of not having a lie queued up] {Embarrassed} The Voodoo Lady gave me the locket and told me to find you so I could track down La Esponja Grande for her so we can cure--
156)  DECAVA
{Angry} I don't see a ring, Señor Liebrush.
157)  GUYBRUSH
[Realizing he's in real danger]{Stern} I'm not after the Voodoo Lady's heart OR La Esponja Grande.
158)  
I uh... I uh...
159)  GUYBRUSH
[Timid]{Worried} Hey De Cava...
160)  DECAVA
{Angry} Get away from me, or I'll kill you! You don't sail another man's ship, simply because he left it in the harbor!
161)  MORGAN
[Mumbles, coming to] ...Guybrush?
162)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Upsy-daisy mon adversaire.  That'll teach you to take a legendary pirate at sword point.
163)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You lost your weapon privileges.
164)  MORGAN
{Questioning} Hmmph. Where ARE we?
165)  GUYBRUSH
[Quickly to the point] {Cocky} We've been swallowed by a giant manatee and you're about to pose as my fake wife in order to placate a puzzle-obsessed whack-job.
166)  MORGAN
{Serious} Oh no I'm not.  {Sarcastic}As much as I'd love to play house with THE Guybrush Threepwood, I'm already late getting you back to Flotsam Island.
167)  WINSLOW
[Going all Poxy]{Evil} Listen here, you poor excuse for a prissy privateer! Any more lip out of you, and the Captain'll be sending yer carcass on a tour of the small intestine!
168)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} I guess we call this the good pirate bad pirate routine.
169)  WINSLOW
[Recovering]{Surprised} Oh my! Ahem. {Concerned} I'm terribly sorry. I think I ought to rest for a spell. Must've taken a mouthful of something vile on the way down.
170)  GUYBRUSH
SEE?!?  That's the Pox!{Stern} It turns people into... whatever THAT was and it's in the process of ravaging the entire Caribbean...{Worried}even...Elaine.
171)  MORGAN
[Realizing she is going to help Guybrush]{Questioning} Your wife.
172)  GUYBRUSH
Yeah.
760)  MOOSE
Yeah.
173)  MORGAN
[Playing hardball]{Stern} Okay, fine, but you have to do something for ME.
174)  MORGAN
[Shifting gears COMPLETELY, letting her fangirl slip out]{Happy} Will you sign this for me?
175)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Two seconds ago you were ready to slit my throat and now you want to hang me in your locker?
176)  MORGAN
{sarcastic} I was just doing my job.
177)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] [resigned]{Incredulous} Give it here.
178)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Now let's go deal with kooky Coronado De Cava.
179)  GUYBRUSH
You're my make believe wife, so just act like it.
180)  DECAVA
{Sarcastic} Well, well, well, the panty-waisted pirate wannabe has found himself a lady!
181)  GUYBRUSH
{Proud} Coronado, I'd like to introduce you to my wife, E--
182)  MORGAN
{Excited} Morgan.
183)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} RIGHT. So as you can see, there is no way I could be romantically affiliated with the Voodoo Lady.{Cocky} I am a one woman man.
184)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} Sure you are, lover boy. If you two are REALLY just wed, you don't mind answering a few questions?
185)  MORGAN
{Fierce} Do your worst!
186)  GUYBRUSH
[Aside, to Morgan]{Cocky} I appreciate the enthusiasm, but easy, girl.
187)  DECAVA
{Sarcastic} Together now, how did you meet?
188)  GUYBRUSH
[In unison with Morgan]{Worried} Uh...
189)  MORGAN
[In unison with Guybrush]{Terrified} Uh...
190)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Spelunking!
191)  MORGAN
[Just a quarter beat after Guybrush] {Terrified} We met through work!
192)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Pilates!
193)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} We met through work!
194)  MORGAN
[In unison with Guybrush] We met through work!
195)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} Hmm. Where did you go on your first date?
196)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uhh...
197)  MORGAN
{Terrified}Uhh...
198)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} The Sunken Discotheques of Pogowatu.
199)  MORGAN
{Questioning} We-- what? [Distracted by Guybrush's answer]
200)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} The circus!
201)  MORGAN
{Excited} We went sailing.
202)  GUYBRUSH
[In unison with Morgan] {Surprised} We went sailing.
203)  MORGAN
[In unison with Guybrush]{Excited} We went sailing.
204)  DECAVA
{Suspicious}All right, that's enough.
205)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} You believe us?
206)  DECAVA
Almost.
207)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Almost? What do I have to do to prove to you that I'm not your rival for the Voodoo Lady?
208)  DECAVA
Just take a step forward.
209)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Okay...
210)  DECAVA
Both of you.
211)  DECAVA
Now let's get down to brass barnacles.
212)  DECAVA
{Cocky} I've asked you both a series of personal questions, the answers of which are recorded here on these cards. Mr. Threepwood, you'll be happy to know that your "wife" has passed with flying colors. She seems to know every single detail of your life.
213)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} You don't say.
214)  DECAVA
Now it's your turn. Let's see what you know about Mrs. Threepwood.  Answer three in a row correctly, and I'll believe you are honeymooners. Incorrectly and...
215)  DECAVA
{Stern} It's the bowels of the beast for both of you!
216)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} Well, perhaps I was mistaken... you two might be married after all.
217)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Oh, it's all right, if a guy turns up in a manatee with your girlfriend's locket a man has the right to ask a question or two. Now, about this sponge...
218)  DECAVA
The one you're NOT after?
219)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}We're just sightseeing. Right, HONEY?
220)  MORGAN
{Excited}That's right, Pookie-Pie.
221)  DECAVA
{Happy} Well, perhaps you would like to join my crew? It could make a romantic tale for your honeymoon scrapbook.
222)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} You have a crew? Are you counting your mood swings as members?
223)  DECAVA
I set out from Flotsam Island all those years ago with four other brave souls, all of whom were to play a special role in finding La Esponja. I may have been a stern leader, but I loved them like sons.
224)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Were you... forced to eat them?
225)  DECAVA
{Sad} I would've rather starved than see harm befall them! Alas, they perished in the belly of the beast long ago. A torturous demise.
226)  GUYBRUSH
Sorry 'bout that.
227)  DECAVA
[Tortured] Sometimes I can still hear their screams.
228)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I'd love to join your crew! I'm ga-ga for scrapbooking. We'll find La Esponja Grande in no time.
229)  GUYBRUSH
{Default}What's next? {Incredulous} A stool sample?
230)  DECAVA
No, you look like a man of firm constitution. Now, any questions?
231)  DECAVA
Yes, crewman?
232)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} These sacred manatee mating grounds...it's the home of La Esponja Grande?
233)  DECAVA
That's correct.
234)  GUYBRUSH
Hot.
235)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Why do you want La Esponja Gordo again?
236)  DECAVA
{Enthused} It is a unique voodoo artifact. One afternoon, whilst strolling through her favorite hexer's market, the Voodoo Lady mentioned the power of the giant sponge and I could not think of a more noble gift for my buxom bewitcher.
237)  GUYBRUSH
And you've been on this quest ever since? {Cocky} Couldn't you have just bought her flowers or a custom shrunken-head rack?
238)  DECAVA
{Happy} Imagine her face when she opens the box!
239)  GUYBRUSH
Isn't this thing gigantic?
240)  DECAVA
{Sarcastic} Well, when she removes the bow!
241)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} When are we due to arrive?  {Incredulous} Wifey is getting antsy.
242)  DECAVA
{Enthused} Ah well, I'm afraid the manatee has been lost for some time now.
243)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Lost?{Embarrassed} He's not a eunuch is he?
244)  DECAVA
His plumbing is still in working order. But his internal compass is another matter.
245)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} How can you tell?
246)  DECAVA
Around and around he go... I've deduced that the problem lies within the manatee's inner ear.  So, I'm crafting him a new one.
247)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} That explains the spinning. How are you building an inner-ear?
248)  DECAVA
I'm weaving the husks of Manatee Throat Grubs into a new cochlea for the beast. It's the only way. If you could bring me some, we'll save precious time.
249)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I'm on it.
250)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} It looks like all we have to do is skin a few manatee throat grubs for the old man and then build a giant synthetic cochlea to replace the missing one up in the ear canal, and we'll be on our way.
251)  MORGAN
{Sarcastic} OR, you could give me my sword and I can just CUT our way out of here.
252)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}I'm not letting you slice this poor fella open!{Worried} Manatees are gentle giants!
253)  MORGAN
{Serious} Guybrush...
254)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Back off Susie Slicer...
255)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried}Eeeeeasy...{Scared}WHOA!
256)  MORGAN
[Darn/Drat/Dammit/Blast.]{Fierce} Drat.
257)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy}Hiya, chief.
258)  DECAVA
How's that drink coming along, swabby?
259)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Whatcha' doin?
260)  DECAVA
{Enthused} I'm working on the replacement inner ear and you should be finding me my materials.
261)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Right. Grubs.
262)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Funny thing about your crew...
263)  DECAVA
{Sad} Aww, my crew. Say no more, I don't want to get emotional in front of a new crew member. Oh how their cries haunt my dreams...
264)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} What was that nonsense?
265)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} A pirate face.{Angry} Intimidating. Grr.
266)  DECAVA
I'm an explorer and esteemed adventurer, I don't do those sorts of things.
267)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} Not even a little?
268)  DECAVA
{Stern} Not even a little.
269)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} You need one hundred thousand of these grubs to build one cochlea?
270)  DECAVA
By my calculations, yes.
271)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} This is going to take forever, you know that, right?
272)  DECAVA
{Cocky} Forever? No. Several years? Yes. An ardent adventurer must maintain his focus over the long game, Crewman Threepwood.
273)  GUYBRUSH
[Unfocused] {Confused} Huh? What was that?
274)  GUYBRUSH
{happy} What do you want me to do, Captain?
275)  DECAVA
Gather grubs, time waits for no man.
276)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Uh-tee. [Finishing the word Manatee.]
277)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Shoot.
278)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Okay, one drink, coming up.
279)  
Seeya.
280)  GUYBRUSH
All right, then.
281)  DECAVA
Take care.
282)  GUYBRUSH
What a mug.
283)  GUYBRUSH
The Narwhal's cannon. While it lacks firepower, it does look scary.
284)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Eww, a slimy grub.
285)  GUYBRUSH
A manatee throat grub. I guess this is what De Cava is after.
286)  GUYBRUSH
Gotcha!
287)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava's plans to rebuild the manatee's inner ear, or cochlea. They're remarkably comprehensive, considering they were drafted by a wack-job.
288)  GUYBRUSH
A steamer trunk. It's probably full of junk. Or secrets!
289)  GUYBRUSH
It's probably full of De Cava's personal effects.
290)  GUYBRUSH
The Narwhal's quarters. They're resplendent.
291)  GUYBRUSH
[Talking through a door] Van Winslow, how are you feeling?
292)  WINSLOW
[muffled] [Poxy] I don't need your sympathy, Threepwood! I'll string you up the mizzenmast and let the gulls pick your flesh off the bone!
293)  GUYBRUSH
[Talking through a door] So...not great.
294)  GUYBRUSH
[Talking through a door] [Scared] Everything okay in there?
295)  WINSLOW
[muffled] [Not poxy] Most certainly, sir! I'm just relaxing with a glass of warm milk.
296)  GUYBRUSH
[Incredulous] Okay...
297)  GUYBRUSH
[Talking through a door] [Caring] Wiiiiinslow...
298)  WINSLOW
[muffled] [Poxy] I'm not yer buxom buddy, Captain Skippy! You'll say my name with fear or face the wrath of my cutlass!
299)  GUYBRUSH
Yeesh.
300)  GUYBRUSH
Eustachian passage!
301)  DECAVA
Where has my monocular run off to?! Slippery devil...
302)  WINSLOW
Sir! If I may have a word!
303)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} How're you doing, Winslow? Can I get you anything? Mug o' bile?
304)  WINSLOW
I'm well, thank you. I wanted to inform you, as I was crawling back under the covers, I came across something... unsettling.
305)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Not another outbreak of Polynesian bed mites.
306)  WINSLOW
No, and I've seen my fair share of disturbing things between the sheets, sir.
307)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} Ahem. What was it, Winslow?
308)  WINSLOW
I believe a threat, sir. I left it over on the gangplank. It came with a note. Something about this being what happens to those who try to interfere with the Brotherhood.
309)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Mmm... I love these things.
310)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised}Gasp! And a seahorse head!
311)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Seabiscuit!!!
312)  GUYBRUSH
The helm of the Narwhal. Where I do most of my helming, if we happen to be afloat.
313)  GUYBRUSH
A bucket full of grubs. I really hope food isn't THAT scarce in here.
314)  GUYBRUSH
Looks like De Cava's managed to collect quite a few grubs already... only a few more decades of grub hunting to go.
315)  DECAVA
{Happy} Splendid! You've found a manatee throat grub!
316)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Let's build a cochlea!
317)  DECAVA
That's the plan! Only 99,999 left!
318)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Come again?
319)  DECAVA
{Enthused} Each grub yields such a small amount of useable husk, by calculations I'll need another hundred thousand.
320)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Hahaha, right...
321)  DECAVA
{Stern} This is no laughing matter, Threepwillow.
322)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} We don't have time to collect that many grubs.
323)  DECAVA
{Happy} On the contrary, time is all we do have! Rest assured, it will all pay off in the end.
324)  GUYBRUSH
[To himself] {Suspicious} This is bananas. New plan: find the ACTUAL cochlea.
325)  DECAVA
Well done!
326)  DECAVA
Keep 'em coming!
327)  DECAVA
Only 50,000 more to go!
328)  DECAVA
We're almost home!
329)  DECAVA
Excellent! That's all the grubs we need!  We'll be out of here faster than you can say dusky leaf monkey!
330)  GUYBRUSH
Dusky leaf monkey.
331)  GUYBRUSH
Better not. She'll just try to stick it in something inconvenient. Like me, for instance.
332)  GUYBRUSH
I found a seahorse head.
333)  DECAVA
Ah, a summoned sea-horse of Spinner Cay. Prime manatee food.
334)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Minimalistic, airy, with a warm layer of mucus. I really love what De Cava's done with the place.
335)  GUYBRUSH
Hey, I found your monocular.
336)  DECAVA
Thank heavens! No damage done to it?
337)  GUYBRUSH
I think it's just how you left it.
338)  DECAVA
Well then, back to planning!
339)  GUYBRUSH
Your monocular, boss.
340)  DECAVA
Thank heavens! I was going mad without them.  No harm done to them?
341)  GUYBRUSH
Uhh...the lens was...cracked when I found it so I replaced it.
342)  DECAVA
How resourceful of you, crewman! Taking after old Coronado I see!
343)  GUYBRUSH
Better not, the Voodoo Lady said that De Cava was important to finding the sponge.  And I'm generally not the "run 'im through" type.
344)  GUYBRUSH
Your mug, sir.
345)  DECAVA
It's empty. What part of "I'd like a drink" did you not understand?
346)  GUYBRUSH
Oh a DRINK. Let me get right on that.
347)  DECAVA
I'm parched, I would love a drink.{Stern} But none of that yellow muck. Dangerous stuff that is, makes my eyes go wilder than a frothing pomeranian.
348)  GUYBRUSH
You got it.
349)  DECAVA
Good thinking, best to stay hydrated.  I'll have another. Remember, no yellow.
350)  DECAVA
Ah, a mug full of the biley bubbly.
351)  DECAVA
Refreshing.
352)  DECAVA
I thought I told you no yellow?
353)  GUYBRUSH
Those other flavors are for wimps!
354)  DECAVA
Are you trying to kill me? I told you, I lose complete ocular control!
355)  DECAVA
And thank you for avoiding the corrosive yellow ichor.
356)  DECAVA
BLEECH! EEEEAAAAOOWWWWWWW!
357)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Check out those eyes!
358)  DECAVA
BURRRRP!
359)  DECAVA
[Recovering] Even the orange's gone foul!
360)  DECAVA
Never again! It's eustachian runoff or sea water for me from here on.
361)  DECAVA
I'm off ichor, thank you. One too many bad experiences.
362)  DECAVA
Nothing more for me, thanks.
363)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}UGH!
364)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}Smooth.
365)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Thanks for the push. {suspicious}I'd never seen an epiglottis before.
366)  MOOSE
{enthused}[Scream that COULD be mistaken for horror, but we realize it's just enthusiasm] WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
367)  MOOSE
DRINK!
368)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I think we just found De Cava's crew.
369)  BUGEYE
{Stern}What say you, digested SCUMM?
371)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Hey, who you calling SCUMM, Geppetto?
372)  BUGEYE
{angry}[Aggressive] You!
373)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Watch the name calling, Flapjack.
374)  BUGEYE
Or what?
375)  GUYBRUSH
Or...{worried}or...{incredulous}[sigh]
376)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}I'm sorry, we must have taken a wrong turn at Alcatraz.
377)  MORGAN
{happy}He's horrible with directions. {questioning}And anatomy.
378)  NOOGIE
{happy}Welcome to paradise!
379)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Paradise?
380)  MOOSE
{happy}The land of ever-flowing relaxation, soothing tunes, and all the ichor you can stomach!
381)  MORGAN
Eww.
382)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}[Distrusting] What brings you down here?
383)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Just looking for your run of the mill Manatee Cochlea.
384)  NOOGIE
{enthused}Hey! We've got-- [Cut off]
385)  BUGEYE
{stern}[Cutting off Noogie] That's enough. [To Guybrush] {incredulous}I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. {stern}And if I did, that would be a secret of the Brotherhood.
386)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}The brotherhood?
387)  MOOSE
{happy}The Democratically United Brotherhood of the Manatee Interior! {enthused}United we stand! {sarcastic}Together we party.
388)  BUGEYE
{stern}Noogie, Moose, Santino and myself founded our collective after growing tired of slaving away on the crews of tyrannical adventurers, always after some meaningless trinket.
389)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Like, say, a giant sponge?
390)  BUGEYE
{angry}Precisely. We're never going back to our old lives. {stern}The Brotherhood was formed to make sure THIS adventure is a never-ending one.
391)  MORGAN
And you guys just LIVE down here?
392)  MOOSE
{enthused}You mean live it up!  {sarcastic}It's our own little slice of heaven.
393)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Feel free to stay, but {stern}please, don't rock the manatee.
394)  MORGAN
{serious}[Like an ice-cold killer] Here's the plan: you charge Johnny Cirrhosis over there and{fierce} I'll jump the leader and eviscerate his vitals. {questioning}The square playing the bongos {stern}shouldn't be a problem for either of us. {fierce}Whoever gets to him first scores the kill. {sarcastic}Personally, I'll be going for his throat, he looks like a biter.
395)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I don't think that's a good idea.
396)  MORGAN
{fierce}[Still planning] You're right. I'll keep my distance and shoot for an artery.
397)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}No no, I mean, {worried}we can't just slaughter these guys. {stern}The Voodoo Lady possessed De Cava and said they were necessary to getting the sponge.
398)  MORGAN
{questioning}Well, what's your plan?
399)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I'm going to... {incredulous}go talk to them.
400)  MORGAN
{strained}Talk? Mighty Pirates don't talk! We don't have time to talk!
401)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Mo, sweetheart, {cocky}this is what I do. So just sit back, relax and let Guybrush Threepwood take care of things. {suspicious}Go re-lace your corset or shine your pauldron or what have you.
402)  MORGAN
[Exasperated] Fine. {dismissive}But don't come running to me when negotiations fail.
403)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hey, Mo.
404)  MORGAN
{questioning}What is it?
405)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Hey, what's with the attitude, I thought you were a fan?
406)  MORGAN
{serious}I AM a fan,{questioning} I just thought I was the fan of a ruthless buccaneer, {disgusted}not some sensitive pastry chef.
407)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Hey! Pastry chefs are tough as nails!
408)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}It's not really the best time for this, {confused}but how about that guy over there, {incredulous}pretty cute huh?
409)  MORGAN
{happy}Four eyes? Kinda portly if you ask me.
410)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Come on! {suspicious}You should go on a little manatee date with him.
411)  MORGAN
{disgusted}No way. I've feigned enough romance for one day.
412)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Well what about...
413)  
See Noogie over there? Pretty cute, eh?
414)  
Just go give him a quick back massage.
415)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Go give him a quick back massage.
416)  MORGAN
{stern}No way!
417)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Take him for a walk around a bile pool.
418)  MORGAN
{stern}Never!
419)  
Did I say date? I meant RECON mission.
420)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Did I say date? Hahaha.. I meant {happy}RECONNAISSANCE mission. {worried}He's dangerous. {suspicious}My guess? {incredulous}Assassin.
421)  MORGAN
{disgusted}...Really?
422)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Yeah, really.  Here's the play.
423)  MORGAN
{excited}[Super interested now] Shoot.
424)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}It's a three phase operation. First you should...
425)  
Check for weapons.
426)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Check for weapons, {suspicious}give him a pat-down.  {stern}When things turn to duck soup, we need to know what we're facing.
427)  
Slyly interrogate him.
428)  
Inspect his gums in case he is a biter.
429)  
Reflex test. Throw a rock at him.
430)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Interrogate him, {happy}ask him about himself. {suspicious}Let's figure out where this lowlife is from.
431)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Take his hand, {suspicious}test his grip. In case it comes to fisticuffs.
432)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Throw a rock at his head and see if he snatches it out of the air.
433)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}Inspect his gums for pathogens. In case he is a biter we need to know what sort of infections we'll be dealing with.
434)  MORGAN
{stern}[agreeing, taking down direction]Okay.
435)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Second, you must...
436)  MORGAN
Got it. Then?
437)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}Lastly...
438)  MORGAN
{stern}[about to recap something]Okay, so...
439)  MORGAN
{stern}Interrogate.
440)  MORGAN
{Stern}Check for weapons.
441)  MORGAN
{stern}Test his grip.
442)  MORGAN
{stern}Reflex test.
443)  MORGAN
{questioning}And then...[remembering]
444)  MORGAN
{stern}Inspect his gums for disease.
445)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I need you to go on another recon mission.
446)  MORGAN
{questioning}Who this time?
447)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Well, Noogie again.{Stern} I just don't think our information is solid.
448)  MORGAN
Really? {sarcastic}Okay, I'll do my best.
449)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}That's the spirit.
450)  
I need you to go on another "recon" mission.
451)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}You know, you can't just go through life cutting throats and de-hand-itating people.
452)  MORGAN
{cocky}[The killer returns] Oh yeah?
453)  GUYBRUSH
[Gulp] Yeah...
454)  MORGAN
{fierce}Watch me.
455)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What were the findings of your mission?
456)  MORGAN
{cocky}I don't think he's much of a threat.
457)  GUYBRUSH
No?
458)  MORGAN
File him under{sarcastic} Pansy with a capital P.
459)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} ARRR!
460)  MOOSE
{angry}ARRRR!
712)  NOOGIE
{angry}ARRRR!
461)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Ooh, that's a new one.
462)  GUYBRUSH
Okay, I'll be back later.
463)  MORGAN
{questioning}[Cold, sarcastic] Take your time.
464)  
I'll be back later.
465)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Ahoy there...{confused}I'm sorry I don't think I got your name.
466)  BUGEYE
{stern}It's Bugeye.
467)  GUYBRUSH
I've been doing some thinking, {happy}and I'd like to join the Democratically United Brotherhood of the Manatee Interior.
468)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}Is that so?
469)  GUYBRUSH
Yep, {embarrassed}although I'm applying to the Oligarchical Society of the Alpaca Farm as a safety.
470)  BUGEYE
{stern}This wouldn't have anything to do with a missing cochlea, would it?
471)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}No way! {happy}I just like the cut of your jib.
472)  BUGEYE
Well, admittance is as simple as a unanimous vote, {angry}even for a pirate such as yourself. {suspicious}We're a democracy, after all.
473)  GUYBRUSH
Down with the man,{suspicious} and all of that.
474)  BUGEYE
Would you like me to a call a vote?
475)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Yes! {proud}I'm a shoe in.
476)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Not right now.
480)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}You're a real killjoy.
481)  BUGEYE
{stern}I don't take kindly to ruffians messing with the dynamics of the Brotherhood.
482)  GUYBRUSH
Aren't you a bit like the tyrants you claim to hate?
483)  BUGEYE
{angry}I don't appreciate your inference, sweet roll.{stern} We do everything democratically down here. Noogie, Moose and Santino carry equal weight in every decision.
484)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}How about your decision to be a jerk?
485)  BUGEYE
{cocky}No, that one's all me.
486)  
Will you vote me into the Brotherhood?
2127)  
Will you vote me into the Brotherhood?
487)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}What do you say about giving a nod to old Guybrush Threepwood come voting time?
488)  BUGEYE
{stern}Sure.
489)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Come on, why n--{confused} wait, really?
490)  BUGEYE
{cocky}[Uber confident] You can have my vote as soon as you beat me in a pirate face-off. We don't want any weenies in the Brotherhood.
491)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Is this going to hurt?
492)  BUGEYE
[Uber confident] Just your pride, Johnny Cakes. I give you my best pirate face and then{suspicious} all you have to do is top it.  Originality counts.
493)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}I'm a pirate with a face, this should be a cinch.
494)  
Let's face-off!
495)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Let's go another round.
496)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Haven't had enough yet, doll-face?
497)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[HINT] I'm ready to beat you in a pirate face-off.
498)  BUGEYE
Well I hope you've done some face research since our last one.
499)  
Give me the skinny about the missing cochlea.
500)  
Call a vote, I'm ready to join up.
501)  
Bye.
502)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Ready? I'll go first.
503)  MOOSE
{happy}All right! {cocky}We're ready for some pirate-face-off action! {enthused} It's Bugeye, the Viceroy of Visages, {confused}versus...[doesn't know his name]

523)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Now check THIS out.
524)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I've seen a tougher face on a newborn.
525)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Check this one out!

ARRR!
539)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}That's it?
540)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Yep.
541)  BUGEYE
Did you miss me saying originality counts? {stern}Or are you such a pathetic pirate that you had to copy my face to a T?
542)  MORGAN
{questioning}[Disappointed] Really, Guybrush.
543)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Come on! {happy}I added my own flavor.
544)  MORGAN
He might as well have been looking in a mirror! {disgusted}This is humiliating.
545)  MORGAN
Mighty pirate indeed.
546)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Ouch.
547)  MOOSE
{worried}Bummer dude.
548)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}It just slipped out of her hand. Watch, she'll realize her mistake and hurry back for it.
549)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Wait for it...waaaaait...
550)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}[Changing the subject] SO pirate faces.
551)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Better go cop a few new mugs if you want to upgrade from miserable embarrassment to just simple failure.
552)  MOOSE
{stern}By way of unoriginal opposition, {enthused}Bugeye is the victor!
553)  BUGEYE

{stern}I'm just warming up.
558)  MOOSE
{enthused}Bugeye wins!
559)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Corpses can make more faces than you.
560)  MOOSE
{enthused}Bugeye wins after yet another unoriginal face {cocky}by Scrapwood.
561)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}You're about as creative as my great aunt Margerine.
562)  GUYBRUSH

563)  BUGEYE
{stern}No.
564)  MOOSE
{surprised}Can Bugeye be beaten?!
565)  BUGEYE

{suspicious}How about your vote for a fine leather jacket?
593)  BUGEYE
{worried}Oooh, you know I've been in the market. {Stern} But no.
594)  
You were never going to let me into the Brotherhood, huh?

{cocky}Took you long enough to figure out.

621)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Strong, silent type, huh?
622)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Guybrush Threepwood is the mightiest pirate in all of the Caribbean{cocky} and LeChuck is a pansy.  {happy}Say nothing if you agree.
623)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[Sly, cool] Alll right.
624)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Scared ya stiff, huh?
625)  GUYBRUSH
Catch ya later, {confused}don't work too hard.
626)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hi there, Guybrush Threepwood.
627)  MOOSE
{happy}Hola, I'm Moose and that's my boy Santino.
628)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}He has a name?
629)  MOOSE
{confused}Uh, yeah. [Duh...] It's more of a moniker.  {sarcastic}Like "The Santino." He's the coolest cat I've ever known.
630)  GUYBRUSH
Ah. Right on.{suspicious} Dude.
631)  MOOSE
{happy}Can I interest you in a beverage?
632)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Is there a substantial amount of lead in your drink?
633)  MOOSE
Nah man, {happy}this is pure, unfiltered ichor. I got hooked on this stuff when we landed down here.
634)  GUYBRUSH
You're drinking it.
635)  MOOSE
{enthused}You better believe it. And it flows in abundance my friend.
636)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Tell me about ichor.  What sort of varietals does it come in? Any favorite vintages?
637)  MOOSE
{happy}[Alt] Three years ago was a solid year. Potent stuff. {sarcastic}This here is the orange. I dig it. It's got a bubbly effervescence with a tangy palette.{happy} Watch out for the yellow stuff you see in the pools though man,{surprised} the stuff will peel the shell off a nautilus.
638)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What's with the funnel?
639)  MOOSE
{enthused}That's Jumbo Jimbo, my custom drinking apparatus. I break it out for special occasions.
640)  GUYBRUSH
Like lunch time?
641)  MOOSE
{stern}It's important to celebrate life, bra.
642)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What can you tell me about the missing cochlea?
643)  MOOSE
{stern}Nothin, that's a secret for brothers only.
644)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}I propose a toast! It's a special occasion!
645)  GUYBRUSH
I've been thinking I'd like to join your group.
646)  MOOSE
{worried}You'd have to talk Bugeye about that.  He's our unofficial head honcho, hombre.
647)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Think I could count on your vote?
648)  MOOSE
{worried}Man, that's a tough one. I try not to get too wrapped up in the politics of the group.  {happy}That's the beauty of democracy, man -- {sarcastic}let other people make the big decisions and you can just ride the wave.
649)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Nice technique.
650)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Thanks for your vote...{confused}um...{embarrassed}bra.
651)  MOOSE
Anytime man! {happy}Thank Santino! He's the man.
652)  MURRAY
{angry}Yeah, thank me cupcake!
653)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Thank you, Santino...
654)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}See ya.
655)  MOOSE
Later on.
656)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hi.
657)  MOOSE
{happy}'Sup.
658)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Ahoy there.
659)  NOOGIE
{concerned}Oh,{happy} hi.
660)  GUYBRUSH
You're in charge of the tunes, huh?
661)  NOOGIE
{concerned}I just like to play. {happy}It relaxes me.
662)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}I can relate, I went through a mouth-harp phase. I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate.
663)  NOOGIE
{happy}I'm Noogie. {surprised}What's your pretty girlfriend's name?
664)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}She's {happy}not really my girlfriend. Her name's Morgan LeFlay...{suspicious}why, you think she's hot stuff?
665)  NOOGIE
{concerned}Well... {happy}yeah.
666)  GUYBRUSH
She'd chew you up like a pinky finger in a piranha pool.
667)  NOOGIE
{enthused}[Overwhelmed] Heh...awesome.
668)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Noogie, my man!
669)  
Choice beats!  Think you can play something more up-tempo?
670)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I like the beat,{happy} how about something a little more up-tempo?
671)  NOOGIE
{happy}Like this?
672)  GUYBRUSH
I dig it.
673)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}I could really use your vote into the Brotherhood.
674)  NOOGIE
{concerned}Oh, I don't know about that. {cocky}We've got a pretty stable foursome here. {suspicious}And I don't think Bugeye likes you much anyway.
675)  GUYBRUSH
Well, let me do you a favor.
676)  NOOGIE
Like?
677)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I'll give you my prize pocket protector!
678)  NOOGIE
{suspicious}Why would I want that? What am I? Some kind of nerd?
679)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Uh...sextant do anything for ya?
680)  NOOGIE
No.
681)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}I'll do your laundry for a week!
682)  NOOGIE
{suspicious}We let the manatee's natural enzymes run their course when it comes to cleanliness, so, no.
683)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I'll get you a date with the beautiful, dangerous, Morgan LeFlay.
684)  NOOGIE
{concerned}Really? {confused}You think she'd say yes?
685)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}To a stud such as yourself? Of course.
686)  NOOGIE
{happy}Wow, okay. If the date goes well, you have my vote.
687)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Deal.
688)  NOOGIE
{suspicious}In the meantime, here is a new member's manual, {happy}it might be worth looking over if you're serious. It's full of our initiation rituals, neophyte duties, etcetera.
689)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Hazing rituals?
690)  NOOGIE
{concerned}By law, we're no longer allowed to use the word hazing. {happy}We call them enhanced initiation techniques.
691)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Sounds delightful.
692)  GUYBRUSH
One date, coming up.
693)  
I'll get you a date with Morgan LeFlay!
694)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You enjoy it down here?
695)  NOOGIE
{happy}Oh yes.{concerned} I would've never been able to abandon Coronado De Cava, but once we split, I realized what I'd been missing. {stern}I'll never work for another tyrant again.{happy} Democracy makes life worth living. It gives me a voice.
696)  GUYBRUSH
The humidity doesn't get to you?
697)  NOOGIE
{cocky}You adjust to it.
698)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I've been thinking I'd like to join your group.
699)  NOOGIE
{happy}Oh, well, Bugeye generally handles administrative matters, you should talk to him.
700)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}You seem like a stand-up sort of guy.  Tell me about the missing cochlea.
701)  NOOGIE
{stern}Never. I made a promise of Brotherhood with these men and I'll never break it. It's a secret for brothers only.
702)  
Tell me about the missing cochlea.
703)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}What do you say to giving my girl Morgan another shot?
704)  NOOGIE
{concerned}I don't know... our last date didn't go so well.
705)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Just because she's cute doesn't mean she doesn't get nervous too!{worried} Behind all of that leather is a wilting flower!
706)  NOOGIE
{happy}All right... I guess I can understand a case of nerves. I'll do it.
707)  NOOGIE
{confused}Another? {stern}Our last date went terribly! {confused}Is she desperate or something?
708)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}She just really likes you. {embarrassed}And I'd like your vote.
709)  NOOGIE
{concerned}Oh, okay.{happy} She can have another shot.
710)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Thanks for the vote!
711)  NOOGIE
[happy]Thank YOU!{cocky} I think I've got a future with that piping-hot pirate hunter!
713)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ooh, that's a good one.
714)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Bye, Noogie.
715)  NOOGIE
{happy}Bye.
716)  BUGEYE
{stern}Hey you, rabble-rouser.
717)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Yes?
718)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}Are you enjoying your time with the Democratically United Brotherhood of the Manatee Interior?
719)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}How could I not? Can't wait to be voted in.
720)  BUGEYE
We'll see about that. {stern}In the mean time, I don't want any trouble.{incredulous} We got it nice and easy down here.
721)  GUYBRUSH
Okey dokey.
722)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}Just some friendly advice: don't be poking around up top and {stern}stay away from De Cava. The last thing this manatee needs is his sense of direction restored. We don't need to be getting to any sacred mating grounds.
723)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[Going along with it.] Seriously. {sarcastic}I've never seen manatees mate before, {disgust}but I'm pretty sure I don't want to be inside one when I do.
724)  BUGEYE
{Stern}I'm glad we're on the same page.
725)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Gentlemen! Goldilocks here would like join the Brotherhood!
726)  MOOSE
{suspicious}Sweet, voting time, my favorite!
727)  BUGEYE
{stern}Brother Noogie, concerning the initiation of one Guybrush Threepwood, what say you?
728)  NOOGIE
{worried}Umm...{stern}no. No, I don't think so. [Rhetorical] {confused}What's he got to offer?
729)  NOOGIE
{confused}Umm...{happy}yes. I vote yes. {cocky}I think he'll help raise...morale.
730)  BUGEYE
Hmmph. Doubtful.
731)  BUGEYE
{stern}Brother Moose? {suspicious}What say you?
732)  MOOSE
{stern}I gotta go with my boy Santino on this one.
733)  MURRAY
{realizing}Well, Threepwood has recently done me an extraordinary favor.
734)  BUGEYE
{stern}Your vote then?
735)  MURRAY
Of course my vote is...{evil}NO! NEVER! {angry}I would never allow him to revel in the joy of being a Brother!
736)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What?! I got you a body!
737)  MURRAY
{evil}MUWAHAHAHA! {angry}Making my betrayal all the more {evil}EVIL! I am the king of torment! I shall torture your soul for eternity!
738)  MOOSE
{worried}[A nay vote] Yeah, nah bro.
739)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Two nays then.
740)  MURRAY
{angry}Never! Threepwood shall never know the pleasure of the Brotherhood.
741)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Moose?
742)  MOOSE
{stern}Nope.
743)  MOOSE
I gotta vote with my boy Santino on this one.
744)  BUGEYE
An obvious no.
745)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What? {surprised}This is ridiculous!
746)  MURRAY
{angry}Yes! {evil}Roll out the red carpet and let it run with the blood of Threepwood's torment! {angry}Ready the rack! Oil up the thumbscrews!
747)  MOOSE
{happy}Ha man, you're somethin else, Santino. {default}I say yea, {happy}my boy's got an eye for character.
748)  BUGEYE
{angry}Ugh, fine.
749)  BUGEYE
{cocky}And of course, my vote.  Which is{stern} NO.
750)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Shocker.
751)  BUGEYE
{stern}I vote no.
752)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}Hey! You said if I beat you in a pirate face-off I'd be in like Flynn.
753)  MOOSE
{worried}Ya man, I think you gotta keep your end of the bargain on this one.
754)  BUGEYE
{stern}[Conceding] Oh all right, but only to maintain the integrity of the Brotherhood.
755)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Bureaucratic ethics win again!
756)  BUGEYE
{stern}I vote yes, as much as it pains me.
757)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Good man!
758)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}Brother Moose, Brother Santino, still yes?
759)  MURRAY
{happy}Oh yes!{evil} Muwahaha...
761)  BUGEYE
{stern}Brother Noogie? {suspicious}Your vote is still yes?
762)  NOOGIE
{happy}Mmhmm.
763)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Not a single yea.
764)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}This is worse than when I ran for class president.
765)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Ah, I'm sorry, initiation can only be confirmed by a unanimous vote.
766)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}What about a simple majority and a high five?
768)  BUGEYE
{cocky}[Sarcastic] Aww, too bad. Initiation to the Brotherhood denied.
769)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Shucks.
770)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Initiation denied. Looks like somebody hasn't been making enough friends.
771)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}I was hoping my natural allure would push me over the top.
772)  BUGEYE
{stern}[Disappointed] You have a unanimous vote, and a formal invitation to join the Democratically United Brotherhood of the Manatee Interior.
773)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}I accept! {happy}Do I get a sash? Or a button?
774)  MOOSE
{happy}[Sincere] Welcome, brother.
775)  NOOGIE
{happy}Welcome!
776)  MURRAY
{evil}Burn in flame!
777)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}You guys should really have buttons. {happy}I think they'd be a hit.
778)  NOOGIE
What you do receive is the honor of one of the Brotherhood's{enthused} greatest responsibilities!
779)  MOOSE
As the most junior member you'll be the caretaker of the cochlea, {cocky}it's the key to our permanent vay-kay.
780)  NOOGIE
{happy}Guard it with your life, brother.
781)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}[Chuffed with himself] One cochlea procured.
782)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}[Unimpressed] Uh huh.
783)  GUYBRUSH
We'll be out of here in two shakes of a pirate's booty.
784)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}I think I've fixed your manatee problem.
785)  DECAVA
{Enthused} How about that! I felt the beast rumble and checked my compass! It says that we're right on course!
786)  GUYBRUSH
Ancient manatee mating grounds, here we come.
787)  DECAVA
{Confused} How did you fix his sense of direction?
788)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Funny you should ask, I ran into your old crew and--
789)  DECAVA
[Disbelief]{Surprised} My crew?
790)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Yeah! And they had the cochlea the entire time! I just pretended I wanted to join their stupid club and--
791)  DECAVA
[Shock - he sees his crew for the first time behind Guybrush] {Scared} My crew!
792)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Yeah, your crew. Alive this entire time. Who woulda thunk?
793)  BUGEYE
[From offscreen] You betrayed us.
794)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Uh...
795)  
Yeah, I totally sold you guys out.
796)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} Yeah, I did kinda sell you guys out.
797)  
I did nothing of the sort!
798)  GUYBRUSH
{Scared} I would never!
799)  NOOGIE
[Outburst, on the verge of tears] We trusted you!
800)  MOOSE
Unbelievable, man.
801)  MURRAY
That was cold, even for you.
802)  GUYBRUSH
{Scared} Look guys, I can explain.
803)  BUGEYE
[Downshifting the elevated tone] There's no need.
804)  GUYBRUSH
[Surprised] {Surprised} Ah, Bugeye! The unlikely voice of reason.
805)  BUGEYE
Breaking the trust of the Brotherhood has only one consequence.
806)  
Expulsion?
807)  GUYBRUSH
{Scared} Expulsion? [Blatantly putting on an air being resigned to this fate] {Cocky} It's okay... I understand.
808)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} One hundred demerits?
809)  
A double fine?
810)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} A double fine?
811)  BUGEYE
Death. Kill him.
812)  GUYBRUSH
[YIKES!]{Scared} Hey-o!
813)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Morgan! {embarrassed}Doll! It's killing time!
814)  MORGAN
{questioning}Excuse me?
815)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}A trio of blood thirsty mutineers are going to pop out of that hole in three, two...
816)  
I could use a hand.
817)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[Running] I could use a hand.
818)  MOOSE
{sarcastic}[Running] Ha! He wants help from a girl!
819)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}Are you still whining over that little scratch I gave you back on the Narwhal?
820)  
It's go time!
821)  
The mutineers were calling you a pansy earlier!
822)  
Look... I'm sorry about before.  We can do it your way.
823)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[Running] It's go time, Morgan!
824)  MORGAN
{dismissive}I can't just be told when to fight! I'm not some junkyard dog.
825)  MOOSE
[Running] Ya man, treat a woman with respect, wouldja?
826)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[Running] The Mutineers were calling you a pansy earlier...
827)  NOOGIE
{worried}[Running] No we weren't! He said you were a wilting flower!
828)  MORGAN
{questioning}That sounds like Guybrush Threepwood.
829)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[Running] Look, I'm sorry about before.
830)  MORGAN
{Sarcastic}Sorry about what?
831)  GUYBRUSH
[Running] About assuming you were incapable of handling the situation. You are capable. Now, {scared}please show these mutineers your capabilities.
832)  MORGAN
AND?
833)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[Running] AND you're a mighty bounty hunter.
834)  MORGAN
{happy}That's sweet, {sarcastic}but aren't you forgetting something?
835)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[Running] Huh?{confused} What? {surprised}[Realizing] Oh!
836)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}[Running] Weapon privileges restored!
837)  MORGAN
{fierce}[Like an ice-cold killer, again] Thank you.
838)  BUGEYE
Get 'im!
839)  MOOSE
I'm gonna crush him!
840)  NOOGIE
I'm gonna watch Moose crush him!
841)  BUGEYE
Kill the betrayer!
842)  MOOSE
Turn and fight, coward!
843)  NOOGIE
[Disappointed] I was going to sew you a sash!
844)  LECHUCK
{humble}There's something about the open ocean that makes a man feel alive.
845)  ELAINE
{sarcastic}I would imagine that simply having a pulse is a bit of an upgrade for you.
846)  LECHUCK
[Making a promise to himself]It's only the beginning.
847)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Just a dab'll do ya.
848)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Whoops.
849)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Mutineers of the crew of Coronado De Cava, I would like to establish, for the record, that the four of you were just man-handled by a woman.{Default} So in essence, you've been woman-handled. {Incredulous}Which, I imagine, was not near as pleasant as it sounds.
850)  BUGEYE
Go dangle your yardarm ya traitor!
851)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Nice work, Morgan.
852)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Now, Coronado, how do we get out of here?
853)  DECAVA
{Happy} I'm fourteen steps ahead of you, mijo. Here, this should do the trick.
854)  DECAVA
{Stern}That's a unique formula of Panamanian Prune juice, east-Indian espresso beans and Booty Breakfast Bran Flakes. A few drops administered to the creature's digestive system should be our one way ticket top-side.
855)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Got it. A few drops in the biggest bile pool I can find.
856)  MORGAN
{Disgusted} Yuck.
857)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} That could've been worse.
858)  MORGAN
{Disgusted} [disagreeing] Really?
859)  GUYBRUSH
Just a quick trip up the blow hole.
860)  MORGAN
{Sarcastic} Manatees don't have blow holes.
861)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} What? Then...[Realizing] {Disgust} Oh, yeah, yuck.
862)  MORGAN
{Questioning} Hey, about down there...
863)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} I was a bit of a monkey's ass.
864)  MORGAN
{Questioning} No, well, yes, but I was going to say that your style's not so bad.
865)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I'm nothing if not stylish.
866)  MORGAN
{Questioning} Anyway, I work alone, {Cocky} but you and I made a decent team.
867)  DECAVA
{Stern} Hey lovebirds! Quit flappin' your gums and get up here! My treasure sits mere fathoms away! [Notices his ship] {Surprised} Gasp! And my ship, the Howler Monkey! I thought I'd never see you again...
868)  DECAVA
{Default} I've dropped anchor down to the mating grounds and the cavern of La Esponja Grande. Now, if only my {Sarcastic} loyal crew [glower at them - they react sheepish]{Stern} was worth a piece of eight.  My star crew member even had the temerity to expire!
869)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's the problem?
870)  DECAVA
{Happy} Santino was not only a world class swordsman, bull fighter and pastry chef. He was also, most importantly, an unrivaled skin diver. There is no other man who can survive the swim down to the mating grounds.
871)  MORGAN
Guybrush can hold his breath for ten minutes.
872)  DECAVA
{Incredulous} Is that so?
873)  GUYBRUSH
{Proud} Keen, eh?
874)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Yep, and I have freakish toe strength.
875)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Yeah, It's a skill I developed in college.
876)  DECAVA
{Confused} Well then, what are you waiting for, Bucko?
877)  DECAVA
{Happy} The sponge! {Stern} And make it snappy!
878)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[underwater] I better not go back up empty handed. De Cava means business.{default}
879)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}[underwater] Uh oh.{default}
880)  GUYBRUSH
[Out of breath] Horrible...teeth...gnashing...ferocious...leviathan...
881)  DECAVA
{Confused} I neglected to mention the guardian of La Esponja.
882)  MORGAN
{Happy} What was it? A Giant Squid? They've been known to hunt and swallow entire corsairs...
883)  GUYBRUSH
[Still gathering himself] No.
884)  MORGAN
{Excited} Gasp! Megalodon? Devil whale?
885)  GUYBRUSH
[Still gathering himself] Worse.
886)  MORGAN
{Sarcastic} What then?
887)  GUYBRUSH
Female...giant...manatee.
888)  DECAVA
{Stern} The monster must be tamed, Cheapwhistle.
889)  DECAVA
What is it, swabby?
890)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I can't WAIT to get La Esponja Grande!
891)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} What? Why do you care about La Esponja?
892)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I uh... Just want to get good marks come crewman review time.
893)  DECAVA
{Incredulous} Ah, very well then.
894)  GUYBRUSH
Sure Santino could understand manatee,{Confused} but how did he make those strange noises to communicate with them?
895)  DECAVA
{Cocky} With the Tongue of the Manatee, of course!
896)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's the deal with you and manatee parts?
897)  DECAVA
{Cocky} It's a device that I planned to market to tourists such as yourself after this adventure was complete. It allows you to produce their sounds.
898)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Ah, so I don't have to put my mouth on anything gross?
899)  DECAVA
{Default} I asked one of my crewmen to watch after it, long ago.
900)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Let me guess, Santino.
901)  DECAVA
{Stern} Certainly not. His skills were not to be wasted on such a simple mission.{Default} It would have been one of the others,{Confused} though I'll be slivered if I can remember which one.
902)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} So one of the mutineers should know where this Tongue of the Manatee is?
903)  DECAVA
I imagine so.
904)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What was that about the Manatee Tongus Maximus?
905)  
How did Santino make all the manatee sounds?
906)  
The Tongue of the Manatee lets me speak to them?
908)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Santino wasn't raised by giant manatees, was he?  How could he understand them?
909)  DECAVA
Learned it on Flotsam Island, I believe, from a scientist.
910)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} [To himself] The Marquis? Hmm...
911)  DECAVA
Even if we could get the winds to work in our favor,{Stern} I'm not leaving this anchorage. I've come too far to risk losing the location of my super-absorbent prize.
912)  
Where did Santino learn to understand manatee?
913)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} You said there's a scientist on Flotsam who understands manatee?
914)  DECAVA
Yes, Santino learned it from him. {Cocky} Good luck getting to Flotsam, though. {Stern} I shall not leave this spot until La Esponja Grande is in my hands!
915)  
What can I say to the female giant manatee?
916)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} My manatee pickup lines aren't what they used to be. {Confused} What am I supposed do or say to the Leviathan to get her to move?
917)  DECAVA
{Embarrassed} That is the only piece of the puzzle I was never able to crack. {Confused} I experimented with thousands of baits, intimidation tactics, presents, sacrifices. {Stern} Nothing. {Incredulous} The females are a truly mysterious species.
918)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} You don't have some cockamamie plan for taking care of the Leviathan?
919)  DECAVA
{Stern} Nothing.  I originally spent three months fabricating a giant manatee suitor to be piloted by a crew of fifteen men, all well learned in the ways of{Cocky} bestial romance,{Whiney} but sadly, they were lost during a trial run. Mashed like peas.
920)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Eesh.
921)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Morgan thinks the Leviathan just needs a male to stand its ground!
922)  DECAVA
Well then, {Incredulous} Cyrano, learn to understand their language and find the Tongue of the Manatee.
923)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Then all I need to do is find her a suitor.
924)  
Morgan's got a plan for dealing with the Leviathan!
925)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} The Tongue of the Manatee is back inside of the manatee we rode in on.
926)  DECAVA
{Incredulous} Then find a way to open his mouth and go get it.
927)  
Whatcha' workin' on?
928)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} So...whatcha doin?
929)  DECAVA
{Stern} Working.
930)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} On?
931)  DECAVA
{Stern} Plan B.
932)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Oh. Good thinking.
934)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} All right, that's enough.
935)  DECAVA
{Cocky} Suit yourself.
936)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey Morgan, I know you're a cutthroat pirate hunter, {Incredulous} but do you have any female insight into this manatee problem?
937)  MORGAN
{Sarcastic} You mean the "monster"?
938)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} The same.{Surprised} This thing is colossal. {Incredulous} Teeth the size of a ship's mast. Been killing any male manatee that gets within a flipper's length.
939)  MORGAN
{Serious} You know she might seem cold and brutal, but she's probably just... {Questioning} I don't know. Lonely, you know?
940)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused}[Oblivious] Shouldn't she just stop murdering anything that gets near her cave then?
941)  MORGAN
{Stern} What did you do when she showed her teeth?
942)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Hello, I ran away.
943)  MORGAN
{Stern} Right.{Questioning} You know what I think?
944)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} What's that?
945)  MORGAN
{Questioning} She needs another manatee to stand its ground and not be so afraid of her. She kills them because that's all she knows how to do.
946)  MORGAN
{Questioning} And if someone could overcome that fear of death and stand in front of her long enough to teach her something different, I think she might just let them.
947)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} [Semi-quietly...is Guybrush actually seeing that Morgan is crazy about him?] And then we could get the sponge?
948)  MORGAN
{Happy} [Still in love with Guybrush] Yes. And then we could get the sponge.
949)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} And then we can cure Elaine. Perfect! Talk a male manatee into standing its ground. Thanks, Mo. You're the best!
950)  MORGAN
[Jostled, recovering from putting herself out there for the first time ever]{Serious} Uh, yeah. {Stern}[Hurt, angry] Don't worry about it.
951)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey, Mo.
952)  GUYBRUSH
Do you know anything about the language of manatees?
953)  MORGAN
[Cool] Nope.{Cocky} I speak a little monkey though.
955)  GUYBRUSH
You work for De Singe, how can I get back to Flotsam?
956)  MORGAN
{Questioning} The next time you set foot on Flotsam, you'll be dissected.
957)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney}Catchy. You ever consider a career with their chamber of commerce?
958)  MORGAN
[Ignoring Guybrush] Sailing there isn't an option...
959)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} [Putting on a fake travel ad] "Lose your heart on Flotsam Island! Along with your spleen."
960)  MORGAN
{Default} What you need is a way to GET to Flotsam without being on Flotsam.
961)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey, that sounds like a puzzle.{Cocky} You really are warming up to my shtick.
963)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Your metaphysical tomfoolery is boggling my mind.
964)  MORGAN
{Questioning} I'm saying you need to get back there but you can't set foot on the island.{Cocky} So, good luck with that.
965)  
How do I get to Flotsam without being on Flotsam??
967)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Those mutineers have information.
968)  MORGAN
{Cocky} I've got ways of making them talk.
969)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} I bet you do.{Incredulous} But you know what? I think I've got this.
970)  MORGAN
{Sarcastic} Yeah?
971)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Yeah.
972)  
All right, thanks.
973)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Thanks.
974)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava's locket, {Incredulous} voodoo trinket or foil-wrapped candy with a nougat center?
975)  VOODOOLADYDECAVA
Guybrush! The voodoo power contained within that locket is not to be meddled with! The last time you fiddled with the powers of Voodoo, you stupidly unleashed the powers of--
976)  VOODOOLADYDECAVA
Did I not make myself clear! Subvert me again and the next time I get my hands on you I'm going to--
977)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Aww, he looks so peaceful.
978)  DECAVA
{Surprised}[Waking up] Well! I, I,{Happy} just had the most magnificent daydream.  I was back in my beloved's home! Her smell still plays on my nose! [sniffs] Mmm... perfumes of potpourri...the brine of shrunken heads... the balm of broken souls.
979)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Look at him! I just want to pinch his sweet little cheeks.
980)  DECAVA
{Happy}[Waking up] Yet another daydream! It's as if I was really there, back in her hut on Flotsam Island...
981)  VOODOOLADYGUYBRUSH
What am I doing in this spindly husk? It can't be Threepwood... perhaps I've leapt into the decrepit shell of a sailor suffering starvation or the torpid corpse of a malnourished deck-hand...
982)  VOODOOLADYGUYBRUSH
Back again? I'd be angry if I didn't feel bad for this emaciated soul...
983)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{surprised} Whoa.
984)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{default} This voodoo throne is plush. Comfortable.  Ergonomic.  No wonder she never stands up when I arrive.
985)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
Now, upsy daisy.
986)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{surprised} She CAN'T get up? But I need to talk to the Marquis De Singe...
987)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
It's a picture of an incredibly handsome adventurer on his way somewhere.
988)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
It has the picture of a fractured scientist on it.
989)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
Man, this body makes me feel smart.
990)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
It shows a woman conjuring a curse.
991)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
A spot for a Tarot Card.
992)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
"Hex Me Now."  I wonder what this does?
993)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
Huh.  Something's missing...
994)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
I think I need a card in each spot.
995)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
Instructions...didn't take the Voodoo Lady for the forgetful sort.  Let's see.
996)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
[Think Guybrush Threepwood] Come on in! Er... [Putting on the spooky voice] Enter my...mystical...lair of voodoo!
997)  DESINGE
Bon jour, mademoiselle. I have traveled here to... pardonez-moi, I can't quite remember.
998)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{stern}  Taking a break from playing around with my --{default}  ahem, with the hand of Threepwood, hmm?
999)  DESINGE
{confused}  Quoi? How do you know of this?
1000)  
You suddenly realized that science is a fad?
1001)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{stern} You suddenly realized that science is a fad, your life's work is a waste, and you'd like a luscious shoulder to cry on?
1002)  DESINGE
{confused} Huh! Never!
1003)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
You've missed my musk?
1004)  DESINGE
{confused}  Quoi?! No!
1005)  DESINGE
{arrogant} Are you feeling all right? You seem...how you say... bizarre.
1006)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
I feel... pretty.
1007)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{happy} I feel great! Lithe! Never better!
1008)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
Actually, I may have really swallowed some bile earlier...
1009)  DESINGE
{confused} Uh...that is nice. I will be going now.
1010)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{mystical} Wait, while you're here, I want to ask you something.
1011)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
What are the odds of a guy like you, and a girl like me...
1012)  DESINGE
{stern} Zero! I will never compromise my science for a bunch of phooey and a pile of chicken bones!
1013)  DESINGE
{stern} Will that be all?
1014)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{mystical} Do you have any secrets you'd like to share? Perhaps concerning Monkey Island?
1015)  DESINGE
{arrogant} You mean zat worthless rock ontop of all zat lava? Nothing, but I hear ze wildlife is quite cheeky.
1016)  DESINGE
{arrogant} Will that be all?
1017)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{mystical} I understand that you speak the language of giant manatees, and I am not referring to your silly accent.
1018)  DESINGE
{stern} How do you know this? Yes, I have a book zat can teach one ze language of these majestic creatures.
1019)  
May I have this book?
1958)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
May I have this book?
1020)  
Excellent!  Run back to your freaky laboratory and fetch it.
1021)  
You don't have anything on tape?
1022)  DESINGE
{arrogant} I feel no need to give it to you! You will just tarnish it with your mumbo-jumbo voodoo nonsense -- you have no respect for ze sciences.
1023)  
Don't make me get out of this chair.
1024)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{stern} Listen, Baguette-for-Brains, I'm warning you.
1025)  DESINGE
{angry} Or what? Your ways have no power over me!
1026)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{angry} Marquis, bring me the book of the manatee language or I'll give you an education on voodoo from the business end of a curse.
1027)  DESINGE
{arrogant} Ha! You make me laugh! [Possibly, maybe slightly nervous] Ha ha ha! This is the sound of my laughter!
1028)  DESINGE
{worried}  With that, I must go!
1029)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{angry} Keep your book. I didn't want it anyway.
1030)  DESINGE
{arrogant} I will!
1031)  
Bring me the book of the manatee language or I will hex you.
1032)  
Fine, keep your stinkin' book. See if I care.
1033)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{mystical} You've returned because you know you have something I require.
1034)  DESINGE
{arrogant} My Manatee language book! Hmmph! Why would I loan such a valuable tome to you?
1035)  DESINGE
{confused} I have returned, but I do not know why...
1037)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
Is everyone from your country so unhelpful?
1038)  DESINGE
{arrogant} The children of my homeland are indeed the finest the world has to offer! There is a reason we call our country the maternal walrus of ze west!
1039)  DESINGECUTAWAY
{angry}YEEEOW! Zat is the ze worst wedgie I have ever known! Heavens to hippos, I can practically taste my underpants!
1040)  DESINGECUTAWAY
[anxious] {worried}  No...it is impossible. She could not have done this to me.
1041)  DESINGECUTAWAY
{worried} Perhaps I will bring her this silly textbook, just in case.
1042)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{default} Who ever could it be? It's ooooooopen.
1043)  DESINGE
I have brought you the language textbook you have requested.{confused} My motivations for this act are meaningless. Take it.
1044)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{happy} Aww, for ME? Thanks, Marq. Put it there on the table.
1045)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{stern} Now scram.
1046)  DESINGE
{angry}Hmmph!
1047)  DESINGECUTAWAY
{angry} Yeeeow! What a terrible wedgie! I wonder what could have caused this?
1048)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
"Learn the enchanting language of the giant sea-cow in twelve easy steps."
1049)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{surprised} Wow, who knew manatees had such an impressive vocabulary?
1050)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{surprised} That wasn't so bad.
1051)  DESINGECUTAWAY
[Dream sequence audio processing] {arrogant} It is impossible... her powers can have no effect on me! Ha, look at me! Stressing out over some trumped up magical threats! Ridiculous!
1052)  DESINGECUTAWAY
[Dream sequence audio processing] [Talking to himself]  {default} Science makes me so hungry! What to have for lunch...perhaps the vichyssoise.
1053)  DESINGECUTAWAY
[Dream sequence audio processing] [Talking to himself] {arrogant} The hand of Threepwood simply isn't enough...
1054)  DESINGECUTAWAY
[Dream sequence audio processing][Talking to himself]{happy} I like otters. They are so cute but potentially ferocious. They are the wolves in sheeps clothing of the sea. Hmm...Perhaps I could develop genetically flambe'd attack otters...[sinister] {angry} oui...
1055)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}I need information!
1056)  NOOGIE
{Cocky} I'll never break!

1067)  NOOGIE
{Scared} Nothing! Just don't do that face again!

1070)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}[Frustrated] That's enough.
1071)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}Who had the Tongue of the Manatee, scumbag?
1072)  GUYBRUSH

1076)  MOOSE
Not telling you, man. I'll never talk. Santino's with me on this.
1077)  MURRAY
Yeah! We'll rot before you know anything.
1078)  MOOSE
{Happy} Solidarity, brother.
1079)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}Tough guys, huh?{Stern} Let's see what happens when I tighten the screws.
1080)  MOOSE
{Cocky}Hurt me all you want, I'll never sing for the man.
1081)  MOOSE
{Cocky}Ha, you can't scare me with Santino by my side.
1082)  MURRAY
The fires of my rage will keep you warm, brother!

1108)  MOOSE
{Sad} I didn't have it, bro.
1109)  MORGAN
He's telling the truth,{Sarcastic} or at least he thinks he is.
1110)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} All right. Who's next?
1111)  MOOSE
{Sad} I had it! Please, bra, don't hurt anyone else!
1112)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Is this true?
1113)  MOOSE
{Sad}[Distraught] It's Jimbo, the Ichor funnel. That's the Tongue of the Manatee. I left it back in the big guy's stomach. [Sigh] I can't believe he's gone...
1114)  NOOGIE
{Scared} I don't know! It wasn't me! I can't remember though, you've gotta believe me!
1115)  GUYBRUSH
I do, but does{Stern} Sister Agnes?

Please!
1117)  MORGAN
{Cocky} He doesn't know.
1118)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Oh, all right. My face cramps up when I do it anyway.
1119)  NOOGIE
{Scared} It was Moose! Moose had it! Please no more!
1120)  MOOSE
{Confused} I said I can't remember, bra.
1121)  NOOGIE
{Scared} It's Jimbo, his Ichor funnel. That's the Tongue of the Manatee.

1123)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I wonder.

{Scared} I didn't have it! I can't remember who had it, but it wasn't me!
1125)  MORGAN
He's telling the truth.
1126)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} What? I didn't even have to do anything.
1127)  MORGAN
Sometimes they break easy, like delicate, Faberge Eggs. {Sarcastic} Look at him, he's a wreck.

[Overcome with excitement, forgetting that it's De Cava's sponge] {happy} MO! I got it! We finally got it! [Leaning in] {cocky} We really hoodwinked old Coronado, eh? [Louder] {happy} Now I've just got to get back to her and--
1152)  DECAVA
{evil}I knew it.
1153)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised} Huh? No, De Cava, it's not like that...
1154)  DECAVA
{evil}You're a backstabbing sponge and woman stealer. This is the end of the line.
1155)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney} Really, hear me out!
1156)  DECAVA
{cocky}Gentlemen, this is why you always have a plan B.
1157)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} If I could just reach that rope...
1158)  MORGAN
They're getting away!
1159)  MORGAN
Grr!
1160)  MORGAN
We've got to get out of here!
1161)  GUYBRUSH
I'm not close enough to cut it.
1162)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Whooaaaaowwww!
1163)  GUYBRUSH
Come back with my sponge!
1164)  DECAVA
[Yelling towards the Narwhal] You'll never have the sponge! Or my lady's love!
1165)  DECAVA
Moose, bring me my prize!
1166)  MOOSE
Sure thing, boss.  I think Santino picked it up...
1167)  DECAVA
What?!?
1168)  MOOSE
Oh....right.
1169)  GUYBRUSH
[To himself] Hey, they forgot the sponge!
1170)  DECAVA
Tack the 'mizzens and bring her about!
1171)  BUGEYE
Yes, sir!
1172)  DECAVA
[Crazed] Then empty the cannons on 'im me hearties!
1173)  GUYBRUSH
Hey, Morgan! They forgot the sponge! Ha!
1174)  MORGAN
They're coming back! Do something, Guybrush!
1175)  MORGAN
Their aim is getting better!
1176)  MORGAN
You've got to sink their ship, Guybrush!
1177)  MORGAN
They'll kill us for that stupid sponge!
1178)  MORGAN
Hurry!
1179)  MORGAN
I know you're a pacifist, but there are cannonballs flying at my head.
1180)  MORGAN
Don't worry about me! Deal with De Cava!
1181)  GUYBRUSH
[Yelling]{stern} Coronado! I can explain!
1182)  DECAVA
[Yelling] {evil}Explain away when you're at the bottom of the ocean!
1183)  GUYBRUSH
[Yelling]{stern} What about the sponge?!
1184)  DECAVA
[YELLING]{angry} Unlike you, IT FLOATS. Give it here and I'll spare your life!
1185)  GUYBRUSH
[YELLING]{stern} No can do!
1186)  GUYBRUSH
[YELLING] {Stern} Where's Noogie?!
1187)  BUGEYE
[Loud-ish] {default} Noogie had a hard time re-adjusting to crew-life. He wasn't ready to give up on Democracy.
1188)  GUYBRUSH
{happy} So he founded his own political party and sailed away peacefully?
1189)  BUGEYE
{default} Sure. He went to a quiet farm upstate.
1190)  GUYBRUSH
[YELLING] {angry} Stop shooting!
1191)  DECAVA
[YELLING] {angry} Ready to give up La Esponja Grande?
1192)  GUYBRUSH
[YELLING] {cocky} Well, no.
1193)  DECAVA
[YELLING to crew] {evil} Shoot to kill, men!
1194)  GUYBRUSH
[YELLING] {cocky}  Done talking to you, wacko!
1195)  GUYBRUSH
[To himself, frustrated]{default} I should've thought of that...
1196)  GUYBRUSH
{worried} Sorry little buddy.
1197)  BUGEYE
{cocky} He's resorted to hurling detritus, sir!
1198)  GUYBRUSH
{happy} Hope you're still hungry, fella...
1199)  DECAVA
{surprised} MANATEEEEE
1200)  BUGEYE
{surprised} MANATEEEEE
1201)  MOOSE
{enthused} ICHORRRRR!!!
1202)  MORGAN
{cocky} Well played, Threepwood.
1203)  GUYBRUSH
{proud} And I didn't even have to run anyone through.
1204)  MORGAN
[Semi-playful] {sarcastic} Yeah, you let a manatee do your dirty work for you.
1205)  GUYBRUSH
Are they...{confused} holding hands?
1206)  MORGAN
{disgusted} Flippers, {happy} but yeah.
1207)  GUYBRUSH
[Wondrous] {happy} Huh. Where do you think they're headed?
1208)  MORGAN
{happy} I don't know. {serious} Wherever nature tells them to, I imagine.
1209)  GUYBRUSH
{proud} That's nice.
1210)  MORGAN
{stern} Yes.  It is.
1211)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava's ship, the Howler Monkey. It might not be the fastest ship in the Caribbean, but it's certainly seen the most bile.
1212)  GUYBRUSH
That slippery savant built his entire ship out of rubber trees. Touché, Coronado.
1213)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Morgan!
1214)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} Everything going all right up there?
1215)  MORGAN
{Stern} Just peachy!
1216)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} How do I free you?
1217)  MORGAN
{Strained} It won't matter if De Cava sinks us to the bottom of the Caribbean! {Stern} Take him out!
1218)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} His ship is immune to cannon fire!
1219)  MORGAN
{Strained} There's got to be some way to sink him!
1220)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Easy for you to say!
1221)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I'll figure something out!
1222)  MORGAN
{Serious} Hurry! {Strained} I can't dodge cannonballs forever!

Tongue of the Manatee: Travel Edition. All the manatee phrases you need to know while visiting the abyss.
1225)  GUYBRUSH
It reads: The Democratically United Brotherhood of the Manatee Interior: A Guide for the Newly Initiated.  The first chapter is "Initiation and You.."
1226)  GUYBRUSH
With a little elbow grease, I can swap the covers on these two books!
1227)  GUYBRUSH
The biggest cochlea I've ever seen. The manatee needs this to regain its sense of direction.
1228)  GUYBRUSH
The Crown of Queen Archipelago. Upon further examination, the jewels are plastic.
2467)  GUYBRUSH
The Crown of Queen Archipelago. Upon further examination, the jewels are plastic.

De Cava's manatee exit concoction.  A proprietary blend of condensed foods to keep giant sea-mammalia regular.
2464)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava's manatee exit concoction.  A proprietary blend of condensed foods to keep giant sea-mammalia regular.
1230)  GUYBRUSH
The Fisheye of the Manatee. It has a red tinted lens.

This salmon sure does flop around a lot. Woo woo...
2469)  GUYBRUSH
This salmon sure does flop around a lot. Woo woo...
1232)  GUYBRUSH
A squishy grub.
2470)  GUYBRUSH
A squishy grub.
1233)  GUYBRUSH
Aww, my hook. Sometimes I pretend it's just a really skinny hand.
2471)  GUYBRUSH
Aww, my hook. Sometimes I pretend it's just a really skinny hand.
1234)  GUYBRUSH
The locket the Voodoo Lady gave me to give back to her boyfriend Coronado De Cava. It most certainly has cooties.
1235)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava's monocular. A single lensed device he uses to see while working in the darkness of the manatee's throat.
1236)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava's empty mug. I should really get him that drink.
1237)  GUYBRUSH
Stinky earwax.  Ugh, it smells like rotten marmalade.
1238)  GUYBRUSH
It's a picture Morgan clipped of me. I think this was taken right after I saved the village of Kaflu from a lava slide whilst constructing the cutlass. Or it's from a wanted poster. It's hard to say.
1239)  GUYBRUSH
One mug of safe-to-drink orange ichor. Blech.
1240)  GUYBRUSH
A mug of yellow bile. Apparently it's nigh undrinkable.
1241)  GUYBRUSH
The Democratically United Brotherhood of the Manatee Interior's New Members manual, with the cover of a Torture Handbook.
1242)  GUYBRUSH
An ancient Torture Manual with the cover of the Democratically United Brotherhood of the Manatee Interior's New Members Manual.  It should not be considered a veiled criticism of democracy.
1243)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, these lenses are about the same size.
1244)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava's monocular now has a red lens. He'll see the manatee through rose-tinted glasses.  Or uncover loads of secret messages!
1245)  WINSLOW
She's out cold, sir.
1246)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Winslow, I need to revive Morgan and present her to De Cava as my fake wife.
1247)  WINSLOW
{Cocky} My, that reminds of the the time...
1248)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Not now, Winslow! De Cava's crazy!
1249)  WINSLOW
{Happy} Very well.  I'm well trained in naval first aid. Do as I say.
1250)  WINSLOW
{Concerned} First things first. Take her pulse and see if she's alive.
1251)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} What? She might be dead?!
1252)  WINSLOW
You never know about these things. Her wrist, captain.
1253)  WINSLOW
Her pulse can be found on her wrist, Cpt. Threepwood.
1254)  WINSLOW
While the neck is also a prime location to take a lady's pulse, her wrist should suffice. Best to not get fresh.
1255)  WINSLOW
{Happy} Excellent, she's alive and kicking. Which reminds me, next, remove any and all weapons from the victim. We don't want her thrashing about and lopping off any more appendages.
1256)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Good thinking.
1257)  WINSLOW
Remove her sword, sir.
1258)  WINSLOW
{Default} Now elevate her feet to help with circulation.
1259)  GUYBRUSH
Got it.
1260)  WINSLOW
Elevate her feet, sir.
1261)  WINSLOW
{Suspicious} Don't worry, sir. I've got my eye on Miss LeFlay.
1262)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm...
1263)  MORGAN
[Dreamy mumble, think Wizard of Oz] Gomez...not on the carpet! [Bad dog!]
1264)  GUYBRUSH
{worried} Her pulse is strong.
1265)  WINSLOW
{Concerned} Very good.
1266)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's this?
1267)  GUYBRUSH
[To himself] A tattoo of the name "Gus."
1268)  GUYBRUSH
All right, I've got her sword.
1269)  GUYBRUSH
It's engraved with a name: Dante Dragotta.
1270)  WINSLOW
{Sarcastic} Ooh, he sounds tough.
1271)  GUYBRUSH
Morgan's sword, the blade of Dragotta.
2476)  GUYBRUSH
Morgan's sword, the blade of Dragotta.
1272)  GUYBRUSH
{sTERN} Elevating her feet...
1273)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's this? An Assassin's Ledger?
1274)  WINSLOW
{Sarcastic} Fascinating.
1275)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Who knew bounty hunters were so meticulous?
1276)  DECAVA
{Suspicious}What was the name of her first love?
1277)  DECAVA
{Suspicious}She is quite a skilled fighter. Who trained her in the ways of combat?
1278)  DECAVA
{Suspicious}Who is her greatest idol?
1279)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Ha, that's an easy one.
1280)  DECAVA
{Suspicious}She recently purchased a ship. This vessel is known as "The Knave of...blank."
1281)  DECAVA
{Suspicious}She was recently affected by the death of someone very close to her. Uncle...what?

1297)  DECAVA
Failure! You know nothing of this woman! She is an imposter!
1298)  MORGAN
{Terrified} WHOA!
1299)  GUYBRUSH
{Scared} WHOA! De Cava, no! Give me another shot!
1300)  DECAVA
Prepare to be digested!
1301)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried}I was just confused! All this manatee breath is getting to me.
1302)  DECAVA
{Angry} Failure again! Vaya con dios!
1303)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Nonono! Let me try again!
1304)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} Why should I?
1305)  MORGAN
{Stern} Because you want to be SURE you're not killing innocent tourists!
1306)  DECAVA
Hmm. I suppose you are right. Plus this is more excitement than I have had in years. Fine, again.
1307)  GUYBRUSH
[To Morgan] {Cocky} Nice one.
1308)  MORGAN
{Questioning} What? How did you...?
1309)  MORGAN
[Confused]{Questioning} But...how?
1310)  MORGAN
[Confused]{Questioning} No way!
1311)  GUYBRUSH
[To Morgan]Impressive, eh?
1312)  MORGAN
[Embarassed] IDOL is a strong word...
1313)  MORGAN
{Disgusted} Ugh, come on!
1314)  MORGAN
{Disgusted} Not even close...
1315)  MORGAN
{Dismissive} Wrong.
1316)  MORGAN
{Dismissive} Nope.
1317)  MORGAN
{Dismissive} Fail.
1318)  GUYBRUSH
{Scared} You're not doing me any favors.
1319)  MORGAN
{Excited} Close!
1320)  DECAVA
{Angry} Silencio!
1321)  MORGAN

Open Inventory
1323)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} About this female manatee...
1324)  MORGAN
{Questioning} Yeah?
1325)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Get a male manatee to stand its ground... then what? {Happy} Ooh, I could teach him the courting dance of the Monkey Island cannibals!
1326)  MORGAN
{Stern} Or...how about you get him to string a coherent sentence together? A little humor doesn't hurt either.
1327)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[underwater] Hey there, {suspicious}uh, Manatee!

1333)  GUYBRUSH

[underwater] All right, {cocky}I'll learn to understand you and speak your language and then we'll try this again.{default}
1335)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[underwater] Hi, Mister Manatee! This probably sounds like nonsense to your un-evolved ear, {happy}but I think I can understand you now.
1336)  MANATEE
[Unintelligibile whale sounds - Long] Hmm... the annoying plankton is back. I have half a mind to just eat the little jerk. Doesn't he know what I'm going through?
1337)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[underwater] What are you going through?
1338)  MANATEE
[Unintelligibile whale sounds - Long] He keeps squeaking at me. Meanwhile, I finally get to the mating grounds and I'm shaking in my flippers.

[In Manatee] Do you know the Heimlich maneuver?
1376)  MANATEE
[Unintelligible whale sounds - Medium] Now, can you leave me alone? It's bad enough that the woman I swam thousands of miles to meet wants nothing to do with me.

1379)  MANATEE
[Unintelligible whale sounds - Short] Yes! Please, can we give it another try? I swam all this way... I just want one measly date.

[whale sounds - Short] Who is there? Who has decided it is their turn to die?!
1385)  MANATEE
[whale sounds - Short]  [Whispering] Uh..uh...go little plankton.  You're on!
1386)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] You dare to disturb me!  Would you like me to dye the ocean depths with your blood!?
1387)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Hmm.  Polite in the face of certain doom. Interesting.
1388)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Oh, a funny guy, hm? We'll see about that.
1389)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] I'm not going to let some lummox buy my love with clever words.
1390)  FEMALEMANATEE

1391)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Why should I give you the time of day?
1392)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Ha, there is something endearing about a man without a sense of time.
1393)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Let's say I let you keep your pathetic life and I take a swim with you, where will we go?
1394)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Hmm.  It's been so long since I've paddled the open ocean. That might actually be nice.
1395)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - short] You're not nervous, are you?
1396)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Ha, I appreciate your honesty, even if you are sniveling little shrimp.  You don't find many men with such candor.
1397)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] You think your words can sway me. What will you say when I rip off your head for my collection?
1398)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Short] Haha, that's a new one.
1399)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - short] I can't stand you insecure males!  I don't want anyone with a lot of baggage.
1400)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] That is such a relief to hear.  So many manatees float up to my cave and before I know it they're in a heap of tears and I've gone and disemboweled them.
1401)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] All of you male manatees are imbeciles.  Why do I even bother?
1402)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] You're right.  Entertainment.  Life would be boring without you.  But it is so painful WITH you...
1403)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] This mating ground is as dead as my victims.  You males are a bunch of cold fish.
1404)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Short] Mmm.  I like your style.
1405)  FEMALEMANATEE
[whale sounds - Medium] Watch where you swim.  Nobody knows the way to my heart.

1416)  FEMALEMANATEE
[Unintelligibile "female" whale sounds - Medium] Yes. I think you're funny. And you had the courage to swim here and talk to me.
1417)  MANATEE
[Unintelligibile "male" whale sounds - Short] I'm a pretty tough guy.

{incredulous}That's one angry monkey. Like, baboon angry.
1423)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}The monkey face! I like it.
1424)  GUYBRUSH
I've already added that expression to my pirate face repertoire.
1425)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}One at a time. The last thing I need is them colonizing my trousers.
1426)  GUYBRUSH
It's a ship named "The Howler Monkey."
1427)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Are those manatee flesh bongos?
1428)  NOOGIE
{cocky}Yeah, they produce a great sound.  {confused}I think it's because they're full of bile.
1429)  GUYBRUSH
A pool of acidic yellow bile.
1430)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Noogie's playing has raised the level. Now I can bob for parasites.
1431)  MOOSE
{stern}Whoa, brother, watch the brew. Party foul.
1432)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Sorry. {confused}Do you really like this stuff?
1433)  MOOSE
{sarcastic}Do walrus whiskers tickle when they kiss ya?
1434)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Boy, do they.
1435)  MOOSE
{worried}Come on, {cocky}waste not want not bro.
1436)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}An, original, signed Guybrush Threepwood!{suspicious} Morgan's going to want this back.
1437)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Doesn't that hurt the manatee?
1438)  BUGEYE
{cocky}It's an animal, it doesn't seem to mind.
1439)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Note to self -- keep Bugeye away from Spinner Cay Sea-Pony shelter.
1440)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I'd never punch a manatee.  {worried}Well, maybe in self defense.
1441)  GUYBRUSH
The plaque reads - Fisheyes Alabaster, Anarchosocialist Pirate Philosopher. {proud}One day I hope my portrait has such a fancy plaque...{sarcastic} soiled and forgotten in the bowels of a manatee.
1442)  GUYBRUSH
The portrait of Fisheyes Alabaster.  {confused}It's covered with ancient grime. I can't see the painting.
1443)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Whoa, check out those peepers!
1444)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}They should do nicely.
1445)  GUYBRUSH
Give me the skinny about the missing cochlea, {happy}I can keep a secret. {cocky}I'll never break. {confused}Except in the face of porcelain...{embarrassed}or tickle torture.
1446)  BUGEYE
Perhaps you didn't hear before when you were told that it was a secret of the Brotherhood?
1447)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I did, but I figured you told everybody that, and {happy}come on, {proud}I'm Guybrush Threepwood.
1448)  BUGEYE
I don't care if you're the Queen of Swasiland or the Ghost Pirate LeChuck.
1449)  GUYBRUSH
{default}I've killed him a few times.
1450)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}Sure you have, creampuff.
1451)  BUGEYE
{cocky}Oh I'd just love to. But I can't vote for {stern}some stale-faced trouble maker.
1452)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I've got more faces than the Pope's got noses. Just you wait.
1453)  BUGEYE
{angry}[Bored] Waiting...
1454)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}All right, call a vote.  {cocky}I feel good about my chances.
1455)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}Very well.
1456)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Later Buggy Bilgewater.
1457)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}So long, Threepwuss.
1458)  GUYBRUSH
Fisheyes Alabaster, {suspicious}renowned philosopher or spooky old man who lived at the end of the lane?
1459)  
Tell me about Fisheyes Alabaster.
1460)  MOOSE
{happy}Ya bro, glad to see you're indulging!
1461)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hey Noogie, {incredulous}how was the date?
1462)  NOOGIE
{concerned}At first I was really nervous.
1463)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Yeah?
1464)  NOOGIE
{happy}But it turned out GREAT!
1465)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Nice!
1466)  NOOGIE
{happy}Then she made the first move and took my hand.  {cocky}I knew I was doing well.  Second base!
1467)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Mister Big Stuff over here!
1468)  NOOGIE
{happy}And then before I know it, {cocky}she's got her hands all over me! {enthused}It was AWESOME. {happy}The perfect date.
1469)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Glad to hear it went well.  So I've got your vote!
1470)  NOOGIE
Certainly! Oh man, {sarcastic}I'm putting all of this in my journal.  I even found a strand of her hair on my vest. {happy}That's going in too. As a keepsake.
1471)  GUYBRUSH
Getting creepy.
1472)  NOOGIE
[Excited embarassed] Hehe, sorry.
1473)  NOOGIE
{sad}Terrible!
1474)  NOOGIE
{concerned}It was going all right, for a minute.
1475)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Uh oh, what happened?
1476)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Eek, I'm sorry.
1477)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Hey, some guys are into that.
1478)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}That doesn't sound so bad.
1479)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Ugh.
1480)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Then what?
1481)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Wow, I'm sorry things didn't go as well as you'd hoped.
1482)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Man, I'm sorry it didn't go better this time.
1483)  NOOGIE
{concerned}It's not your fault, I just don't think she's for me.
1484)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Let me go talk to her. {incredulous}I still see love in the future for you two crazy kids.
1485)  NOOGIE
Okay...
1486)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}I understand that.
1487)  NOOGIE
{concerned}She put her hands all over me! There was no warming up to it or anything! {confused}I think she's desperate.
1488)  NOOGIE
She was so forward. {concerned}I'm a guy, I can be physical. But I'm not a piece of meat.
1489)  NOOGIE
{surprised}She just walked over and took my hand, like she owned me!
1490)  NOOGIE
{confused}Come on! Warm a guy up first! Get to know a fella!
1491)  NOOGIE
{stern}She threw a rock at my head!  {sad}It really hurt!
1492)  NOOGIE
{stern}I don't want any rough stuff! {angry}She could've killed me!
1493)  NOOGIE
{stern}She threw another rock at my head!!! Owww!
1494)  NOOGIE
{angry}This girl is wacko!
1495)  NOOGIE
{angry}She shoved her hands into my mouth! Why would I ever want that?
1496)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}[Trying to justify Morgan's crazy date behavior] Different strokes, you know?
1497)  NOOGIE
Not for this guy! Ever!
1498)  NOOGIE
{enthused}She was so into me.
1499)  NOOGIE
{happy}First she wanted to know all about me. She was interested right off the bat!
1500)  NOOGIE
{surprised}But then...
1501)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I think you dropped this.
1502)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}You think right.
1503)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}But what will you hang in your locker?
1504)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}Maybe I'll find a nice full-color LeChuck.
1505)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Ouch.
1506)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You sure you don't want this back?
1507)  MORGAN
{questioning}To advertise for Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pacifist?
1508)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}I killed the ghost pirate LeChuck!
1509)  MORGAN
{dismissive}I'm starting to wonder about that.
1510)  MOOSE
{scared}[Stopping Guybrush] Whoa, {confused}what are you doing, bro?
1511)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}I, uh... saw a spider on Santino here.
1512)  MOOSE
{stern}Don't harm a creature of the manatee, bro! {default}Santino doesn't mind. {happy}He loves bugs.
1513)  
I saw a spider.
1514)  
I was going to give Santino a quick shave.
1515)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}I was gonna give Santino a quick shave.
1516)  MOOSE
{stern}I don't think so. {suspicious}He's pretty particular about his hair. {sarcastic}The ladies can't get enough of it.
1517)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Riiiight...
1518)  
I'm lopping Santino's head off.
1519)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}I'm lopping off his head. {confused} No big deal.
1520)  MOOSE
{happy}Ha, you're wild dude! {stern}But easy with the sword play, {worried}Santino is the only person who knows any first aid.
1521)  MURRAY
{evil}Hahaha! {angry}Threepwood, you have made the greatest mistake of your life! {evil}In my new corporeal form, I will scorch these lands to the ground, {angry}only to rebuild them in my nefarious, all-mighty image!
1522)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}So, you like your new setup?
1523)  MURRAY
{happy}I do.
1524)  MOOSE
{happy}Santino! Bro! You want to spot me on this one?
1525)  MURRAY
{angry}Men pledge their allegiance to me! Our brotherhood is a bond forged in the flames of hell!
1526)  MOOSE
Gnarly.
1527)  MURRAY
{realizing}Perhaps I will revel in this union of brothers for a moment.
1528)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Before burning the world?
1529)  MURRAY
{evil}Terror will come to this manatee, rest assured!
1530)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[Frustrated from trying to remove Santino's skull] Ugh, it's not a clip-on.
1531)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[Frustrated from trying to remove Santino's skull] That skull is sturdily attached.
1532)  GUYBRUSH
The level's too low to take a sample.
1533)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}One cup of horribly corrosive, ultra toxic manatee bile. {incredulous}Delish.
1534)  MURRAY
[Muffled] Let me out of here and I'll spare your miserable life!
1535)  MURRAY
[Muffled] I can't feel my legs!
1536)  MURRAY
[Muffled] Little help.
1537)  MURRAY
[Muffled] My power will not be restrained by this flimsy box!
1538)  MURRAY
[Muffled] Free me or die!
1539)  MURRAY
[Muffled] Free me or perish in flame!
1540)  MURRAY
[Muffled] Free me or...or...or not. But you will pay with your life!
1541)  GUYBRUSH
Long time no see! How did you get trapped in here?
1542)  MURRAY
{angry}I'm not trapped!
1543)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Okay, what were you doing before you chose to hang out in a treasure chest inside of a manatee?
1544)  MURRAY
{default}Well, my legions of undead marines had brought an armada of Spanish clippers to their knees when {angry}a mighty tempest tossed our ship.
1545)  GUYBRUSH
I don't remember hearing about any battle with the Spanish armada.
1546)  MURRAY
{happy}[pickup1] Ha! {angry}As if we would allow a soul to live to tell the tale.
1547)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Would you like some help?
1548)  MURRAY
{shocked}Help?! {happy}Ha! {confused}HELP?! {evil}I will end you!
1549)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Okay, then.  Well, it was nice talking to you, Murray.
1550)  MURRAY
{worried}Grr....um... {confused}maybe a little.
1551)  GUYBRUSH
[Effing with Murray] {suspicious}Come again?
1552)  MURRAY
{realizing}Perhaps a lift.
1553)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Oh! {happy}You'd like help! Let's go, pal.
1554)  MURRAY
Ah! It's dark in here! And why does it smell like rotten marmalade?
1555)  GUYBRUSH
Nothing more in there. I guess it only had room for one demonic skull.
1556)  
Your sword!
1856)  GUYBRUSH
Your sword!
1557)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}[Running] A snack! You should never enter a battle outnumbered on an empty stomach.
1558)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}No...
1559)  
A snack!
1560)  
My lucky ankle warmers!
1561)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}[Running] Of course! You need my lucky ankle warmers. Can't run a man through with cold ankles, that's what my Pa always said.
1562)  MORGAN
{questioning}No, my ankles are fine.  {sarcastic}What I need is...
1563)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}This cochlea is heavy.
1564)  NOOGIE
{stern}Take good care of it, brother! {worried}It is the key to our freedom.
1565)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Cochlea's safe with me, brother!
1566)  BUGEYE
{stern}It had better be.
1567)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Can you hold onto this cochlea?
1568)  MOOSE
{worried}Nah man, I'm not good with things like that.
1569)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Morgan, I got the cochlea!
1570)  MORGAN
{excited}Then go replace it in the ear canal so we can get out of here. {sarcastic}I'd like to get you back to Flotsam while I'm young enough to spend the bounty.
1571)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Can I interest you in this signed Guybrush Threepwood photo?
1572)  BUGEYE
{cocky}If I was chewing gum, that would be a fantastic place to dispose of it. {stern}But as I am not, no thank you.
1573)  NOOGIE
{worried}No thanks.
1574)  MOOSE
Na, I'm cool.
1575)  GUYBRUSH
Not the time to resort to killing.
1576)  GUYBRUSH
That's enough decapitation for now.
1577)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You know anything about a seahorse head left in my bed?
1578)  BUGEYE
{stern}Don't know what you're talking about. {suspicious}You enjoy carrying around a smelly carcass?
1579)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}What I put in my pockets is my business, Stinkeye.
1580)  NOOGIE
{worried}No way. {scared}Ugh, makes me nauseous just thinking about it.
1581)  MOOSE
{surprised}A dead seahorse! {worried}Bummer...
1582)  MURRAY
{confused}Wasn't me. {evil}But I wish it was.
1583)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}That's quite the straw.
1584)  MOOSE
{suspicious}Sometimes you just want a quick rush of ichor. {cocky}This baby does the trick.
1585)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Mug of ichor?
1586)  MOOSE
I'm solid, bro.  {cocky}Thanks! But don't let it go to waste. {enthused}Hit that, man.
1587)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}No, I am also solid.
1588)  MOOSE
{angry}DRINK!!!
1589)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Why...{embarrassed}okay, fine.
1590)  MURRAY
{angry}Ha, I wasn't born yesterday. If you think you'll assassinate the destroyer of worlds with a poisoned drink, think again!
1591)  NOOGIE
{worried}No, I don't touch that stuff.
1592)  BUGEYE
{worried}Yuck. No.
1593)  MORGAN
{stern}Stop sampling the local flavor and get us out of here.
1594)  MOOSE
{surprised}Whoa pal, what did I tell you about the stuff in the pools? {worried}Even I can't handle that brine.
1595)  GUYBRUSH
Right.
1596)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Murray, {embarrassed}ahem, I mean Santino, {confused}do you want to have a look at this new members manual to the Brotherhood? {suspicious}You might find it pretty interesting.
1597)  MURRAY
{angry}Reading is for the feeble!
1598)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I just thought these initiation rituals might strike your fancy. {suspicious}[Reading from the book] The first step in drawing and quartering your victim is...
1599)  MURRAY
{shocked}Wait, wait... {confused}what was that?
1600)  GUYBRUSH
Just going over some of what I can look forward to when I'm voted into the Brotherhood.
1601)  MURRAY
{angry}Let me see that.
1602)  MURRAY
{realizing}Why, that's positively malevolent! {happy} Look at all the blood!
1603)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Yeah, I'm not looking forward to it.
1604)  MURRAY
{evil}[Realizing he's being had] Wait a minute... {angry}let me see the cover.
1605)  MURRAY
{happy}Ha! It's the genuine article.
1606)  GUYBRUSH
Too bad I can't have your vote...
1607)  MURRAY
Aha! {realizing}You should be careful what you ask for! Consider my vote yours! {evil}And your demise, imminent!
1608)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Would you like another look at the new members manual?
1609)  MURRAY
{happy}Haha, I've seen enough!{evil} I don't want to ruin the surprise!
1610)  GUYBRUSH
Hey Murray, can I interest you in this torture manual?
1611)  MURRAY
Haha, I wrote the book on torture. For instance, taunting a man with his greatest desire is a good form of psychological warfare. As is an Indian rub.
1612)  GUYBRUSH
How so?
1613)  MURRAY
Do you yearn to reap the incredible benefits of membership of the Brotherhood?
1614)  GUYBRUSH
Sure, that'd be okay.
1615)  MURRAY
Well I'll never let you in!!! Ever!!! Does it scorch your insides, Threepwood? Does it fill you with painful sadness? And gas?
1616)  GUYBRUSH
Something does, but I think I swallowed some bile earlier.
1617)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Check out this New Member's Manual.
1618)  MURRAY
{angry}Full of joyous events to celebrate our Brotherhood, no doubt. {evil}Exotic pleasures that you'll never know! Muwahahaha!
1619)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Somebody left a seahorse head in my bed. I think it was a threat.
1620)  GUYBRUSH
Thanks for the manual.
1621)  NOOGIE
{happy}No sweat. Bugeye had us print up three cases of them when a printing press washed up down here a few years ago.
1622)  GUYBRUSH
I've seen my fair share of flesh wounds, and this one is world class.
1623)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} A cochlea, or inner-ear. Hmm. I may have gone to public school, but I think those are supposed to come in pairs.
1624)  GUYBRUSH
Sniff, snifff.
1625)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} Mmm... manatee ear wax. Rotten AND pungent.  Perfect.
1626)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Here you go, pal.
1627)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Whoa!
1628)  GUYBRUSH
I think we're back on course!
1629)  GUYBRUSH
It looks like somebody cut out the manatee's other cochlea.
1630)  GUYBRUSH
No wonder this guy is swimming in circles.  He's missing half of his internal navigation system.
1631)  GUYBRUSH
While it may look like it's full of candy, I believe the cochlea is key to this manatee's sense of direction.
1632)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm... besides causing needless damage and pain, removing this cochlea to replace the other wouldn't make much sense.
1633)  GUYBRUSH
This missing cochlea can't have gone far.
1634)  GUYBRUSH
Woo, smells like somebody left a carton of milk out in here.
1635)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}The rotting remains of one of those seahorse thingies. {sarcastic}Seahorse eats plankton, manatee eats the seahorse, mutineers hijack the manatee... {incredulous}ah, the circle of life.
1636)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey, I've got the cochlea.
1637)  DECAVA
{Suspicious} Ha, I'll believe it when I see it. Trying to get out of grub scrounging duty no doubt.
1638)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Well, I'll just go put this back where it belongs and then it's mating grounds or bust.
1639)  GUYBRUSH
Hey De Cava?
1640)  DECAVA
What is it?
1641)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Check this out!
1642)  MURRAYINHAND
Arrrrgh, buenos dias, Grandpa!
1643)  GUYBRUSH
It's a talking skull!
1644)  DECAVA
We don't have time for silly tricks, crewman.
1645)  GUYBRUSH
I shouldn't bother Winslow with this. He's feeling a little poxy.
1646)  MURRAYINHAND
Salutations, four eyes!
1647)  NOOGIE
Hey, that's not nice!
1648)  GUYBRUSH
Yeah, I can't control him.
1649)  NOOGIE
Sure you can't.  Nice trick though.
1650)  MURRAYINHAND
{evil}Beware my clicking mandibles of doom!
1651)  MOOSE
{happy}Hahaha, raucous! {cocky}When I was a kid I had a crippling fear of ventriloquism.
1652)  MURRAYINHAND
{angry}Hey there sailor, why the sourpuss?!
1653)  BUGEYE
{angry}[Angry] Cute.
1654)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Morgan, I found an old...{embarrassed} fr...head.
1655)  MORGAN
{disgusted}A skull. Wow...
1656)  MURRAYINHAND
{happy}Hello, what's your name sweet cakes?
1657)  MORGAN
{happy}Ha, stop it.
1658)  GUYBRUSH
I'm not doing anything!
1659)  MURRAYINHAND
I might look like just a skull, but I'm alllll man.
1660)  MORGAN
{serious}Not kidding.
1661)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Neither am I!
1662)  MURRAYINHAND
{realizing}What do you say we ditch the zero here, {happy}you and I find a quiet spot near the spleen and --
1663)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}That's enough.
1664)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}I should probably keep Murray away from Morgan.
1665)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Hey Murray, how about a swim?
1666)  MURRAYINHAND
{angry}Try it. If I go, {evil}you're coming with me.
1667)  MURRAYINVENTORY
Man, you keep some strange things in your pockets.
1668)  MURRAYINVENTORY
Who are we gonna freak out next!?
1669)  MURRAYINVENTORY
The grub is in my eye, IT'S IN MY EYE!!!
1670)  MURRAYINVENTORY
You've got some big pockets.
1671)  MURRAYINVENTORY
Hey! Threepwood! I'd really like to get out and stretch my legs.
1672)  MURRAYINVENTORY
If only I could leverage your power of mobility for true evil...
1673)  MURRAYINVENTORY
What's going on out there?
1674)  MURRAYINVENTORY
See ya!
1675)  MURRAYINVENTORY
Ah, it's getting dark again!
1676)  MURRAYINVENTORY
It's lonely in here!
1677)  MURRAYINVENTORY
Come back!
1678)  MURRAYINVENTORY
Grr....
1679)  GUYBRUSH
That's a lot of coin.
2468)  GUYBRUSH
That's a lot of coin.
1680)  GUYBRUSH
Having a good time?
1681)  MURRAYINVENTORY
You and I should team up to take over the manatee, sail it to Booty island, and sack the harbor in a storm of blubber!
1682)  GUYBRUSH
I'll take it under advisement.
1683)  GUYBRUSH
Everything okay in here?
1684)  MURRAYINVENTORY
You've gotta get rid of this grub, I almost swallowed it.
1685)  GUYBRUSH
But you can't taste anything.
1686)  MURRAYINVENTORY
It's still disgusting!
1687)  GUYBRUSH
How's it going, Murray?
1688)  MURRAYINVENTORY
Awful! Your legs are sweaty.
1689)  GUYBRUSH
Yeah, I'm a leg sweater. Sorry about that.
1690)  GUYBRUSH
Can I do anything for ya?

Some fresh air would be nice! Put me somewhere up off the ground!
1692)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}How's the body treating you?
1693)  MURRAY
{realizing}Remarkably well!  It's only a matter of time before I gain control of my limbs.
1694)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Oh boy, then we're in for it.
1695)  MURRAY
{evil}I shall rewrite your definition of misery!
1696)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}You're literate now too?!
1697)  MURRAY
{sad}[Shamed] Not completely.
1698)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Think I can get your vote into the Brotherhood?
1699)  MURRAY
{angry}We are very selective of our members.
1700)  GUYBRUSH
I just scammed your way in fifteen seconds ago! {worried}How about a nod for the effort?
1701)  MURRAY
Okay, okay...sure thing Creepwood.
1702)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}What's the deal? I do you a favor and this is how you repay me?
1703)  MURRAY
{evil}Hahahaha! Do you think I,{angry} Murray the Demonic Skull, would ever let you experience the joy of being {realizing}welcomed into the Brotherhood?!
1704)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Well, yeah, I thought we had a deal.
1705)  MURRAY
{angry}I would rather be reduced to dust than {evil}see a smile on your face come induction time! Muwahaha!
1706)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}You know, I brought you into this world of the bipedal. I can as soon take you out.
1707)  MURRAY
{angry}Threats will never turn my cheek! You'll never have my vote into the Brotherhood!
1708)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You actually like these guys?
1709)  MURRAY
{confused}Like?! {evil}I like no one. {happy}But I LOVE the Brotherhood. {angry}What I have here is a group of men I can mold in my own image! {evil}Their fates are tied to mine! And my fate leads to the highest throne of hell!
1710)  GUYBRUSH
So Brotherhood actually suits you.
1711)  MURRAY
{realizing}Plus, Bugeye is working on a creed.{happy} I love creeds.
1712)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Talk to you later, Murray.
1713)  MURRAY
{angry}Take care, windbag.
1714)  WINSLOW
[Muffled][Sound through door] On the mend, sir! [Poxy cough] Cough! Cough!
1715)  GUYBRUSH
Just wanted to let you know that we're out of the manatee, so, whenever you feel like joining us on deck...
1716)  WINSLOW
[Muffled][Poxy] Try to tell me what to do again and you'll be keelhauled halfway to Sunday!
1717)  GUYBRUSH
Eek. Sorry.
1718)  GUYBRUSH
As much as I'd like to be keelhauled halfway to Sunday, I think I'll let Winslow rest up.
1719)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Santino will snap like a twig!
1720)  MOOSE
Two are like{Confused} three times stronger than one! You'll never break either of us!
1721)  MURRAY
You'll have to kill me! [Aside] And I'm already dead...
1722)  MOOSE
{Happy} You've got nothing on us, bro!
1723)  MURRAY
Yeah, hurt him all you want!!
1724)  MOOSE
{Enthused}YEAH!
1725)  MURRAY
YEAH!!!
1726)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You! Murray!
1727)  MOOSE
{Stern} His name is Santino!
1728)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} [Sigh] Santino.
1729)  GUYBRUSH
Santino!
1730)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I know you know diddly.
1731)  MURRAY
{Realizing} That might be so, {Angry}but I'll never talk! And the wills of these men shall be stronger for it!
1732)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Tell Moose to give up his info.
1733)  MURRAY
{Angry} Never! {Evil} I revel in your frustration with my tight-lipped-comrade!
1734)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} You're useless.

{Evil} Muwahaha...
1736)  GUYBRUSH
{default}It reads: Visit the Sacred Giant Manatee Mating Grounds, Home to La Esponja Grande. 200 fathoms. No littering.
1737)  GUYBRUSH
{default}I spent some good times in that cage...
1738)  GUYBRUSH
May I have a look at your files?
1739)  DECAVA
As a trusted member of my crew, there's nothing I wouldn't share with you.
1740)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Really?
1741)  DECAVA
{Happy} Go right ahead.
1742)  GUYBRUSH
Look at that fish flop! Come here, you...
1743)  GUYBRUSH
If there's one thing democracy has taught me, sometimes you just need to make an example out of someone to get results.
1744)  MOOSE
Frigid, bra. Frigid.
1745)  ELAINE
{stern}[Mildly poxy] Cough...cough... How many more of these filthy creatures do we need to unload before we can {angry}meet up with Guybrush?
1746)  LECHUCK
{concerned}Dozens. {happy}Seven more islands and one peninsula should suffice.
1747)  ELAINE
{surprised}SEVEN?! [Getting poxier] {stern}Listen, Chucky. Drop all the simians on the next patch of dirt we pass and then we find my husband.
1748)  LECHUCK
{concerned}We can't do that, Elaine. These monkeys need to be given proper homes, far apart from each other. {humble}For their comfort and happiness.
1749)  ELAINE
{angry}[More poxier] The chimps can roast on an open flame for all I care!
1750)  LECHUCK
{worried}Elaine. You don't mean that.
1751)  ELAINE
{concerned}Oh, I'm so sorry! You're right. [To the monkeys]{embarrassed} I'm do apologize, monkeys. Lush homes, all around.
1752)  LECHUCK
{concerned}I do apologize for the inconvenience.
1753)  ELAINE
No need to apologize. Actually, {cutesy}it's crazy to say this, {embarrassed}but I'm proud of you.
1754)  LECHUCK
{humble}Really?
1755)  ELAINE
{happy}Look at you, going out of your way to set things right. Whoever thought LeChuck would do such a thing?
1756)  GUYBRUSH
First thing's first.
1757)  GUYBRUSH
I've done enough decapitating and dismembering for one day.
1758)  GUYBRUSH
My mother always told me to use my words. Or at least not to resort to out and out murder.
1759)  GUYBRUSH
My scoutmaster would kill me if he saw me use a sword like that.
1760)  MORGAN
Return fire!
1761)  GUYBRUSH
A picture of me. It's conveniently wallet sized.
2472)  GUYBRUSH
A picture of me. It's conveniently wallet sized.
1762)  GUYBRUSH
Now the arrow points the opposite way.{Incredulous} This should be interesting. Or fraught with peril.
1763)  GUYBRUSH
One of these pictures is square and the other is round.  What a modern design choice.
1764)  GUYBRUSH
Whoa! Look at the mug on that nun!
1765)  MORGAN
[Hit by boom mast]{Terrified} Ugh!
1766)  GUYBRUSH
An encampment! Talk about roughing it. Better go check it out.
1767)  GUYBRUSH
Maybe this will make a better monocular?
1768)  DECAVA
I don't think so; this is prescription.
1769)  GUYBRUSH
I found your monocular.
1770)  DECAVA
Excellent! I'll just...this isn't my monocular. This frame is a flimsy piece of junk!
1771)  GUYBRUSH
But check out that lens! That's quality merfolk craftsmanship!
1772)  DECAVA
Irregardless! Take it back and find my monocular.
1773)  DECAVA
Just as I freed myself from the brig of Phatt Island by bribing the guard for his bootlace, stringing him up with a pulley fashioned from a stale scone and then growing out my toenails over the course of a year in order to carefully carve them into a lock picking kit, I, Coronado De Cava, will walk out of this beast when the time is right!
1774)  VOODOOLADYDECAVA
[Speaking through De Cava's body] And while the pox spreads with every passing moment, you must tread lightly, Guybrush. Years of searching for the sponge have made De Cava unstable.  He was always a bit of a sensitive soul so please, I implore you, do not mention me. Do not mention La Esponja.  And whatever you do, do not tell him where you acquired his locket.
1775)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I'm here to retrieve La Esponja Grande! The Voodoo Lady sent me.
1776)  DECAVA
{Stern} Stop that.
1777)  NOOGIE
A what?
1778)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} You know, like some doubloons. But double the regular amount.
1779)  NOOGIE
But how do we determine the standard fine?
1780)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm not sure. I suppose that's up to your discretion.
1781)  NOOGIE
Wouldn't it be less confusing to just settle on a larger up front--
1782)  BUGEYE
That's enough! The only punishment is...
1783)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky} An embarrassing facial tattoo?
1784)  GUYBRUSH
Mmm.. manatee uvula. It's a delicacy in some cultures.
1785)  GUYBRUSH
It's like a giant, delicious meat stalactite.
1786)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think so. I've always lived by the rule: do unto other's uvula's as you would have done to yours.
1787)  GUYBRUSH

{confused}Captain?
1799)  WINSLOW
{sad}[Realizing] Oh dear.
1800)  GUYBRUSH
A seahorse head. Giant manatees snack on these things like crackers. Man, if somebody made little fish-shaped snack-crackers for people, they'd be sitting on a goldmine.

A seahorse head. Giant manatees snack on these things like crackers. Man, if somebody made little fish-shaped snack-crackers for people, they'd be sitting on a goldmine.

{Cocky} Done and done!
1802)  DECAVA
Hold onto your pantalones!
1803)  WINSLOW
[pickup1] Careful, Captain. Don't you think we should keep her out as long as possible?
1804)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Brotherhood's not so cool now, is it?
1805)  MURRAY
{Evil} Wait until we chew through your ropes of oppression and topple your puppet regime!
1806)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Wow, Murray, {Confused} you've gone political.
1807)  MURRAY
{Realizing} I just learned all those words.
1808)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Talk to you later.
1809)  MURRAY
{Angry} Be gone, oppressor!
1810)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Comfy?
1811)  NOOGIE
{Stern} You're a betrayer! ...{Concerned} But do you think Morgan is still into me?
1812)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Oh yeah. Definitely. See how you still have all your limbs? That means she cares.
1813)  NOOGIE
{Happy} Good.
1814)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} See what you get for being a stick-in-the-mud?
1815)  BUGEYE
{Stern}[threatening] We'll see.
1816)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Sorry to have to go and pull you away from your ichor.
1817)  MOOSE
{Sarcastic} Unbelievable, bra. I thought you and I were going to have buckets of good times.{Happy} Just you, me, Santino, Jumbo Jimbo, partying at the Cantina. Maybe hit the mucus flume for a change of pace.
1818)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}Yeah... I can't believe I'm gonna miss out on the mucus flume...
1819)  GUYBRUSH
Anyway, talk to you later.
1820)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}[Forceful]I REALLY shouldn't.
1821)  MOOSE
{stern}All right man... {suspicious}but that means you gotta double up next time.
1822)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Fair enough.
1823)  MOOSE
{enthused}Righteous! What's the occasion?
1824)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}What did I say earlier about running to me for help?
1825)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}ONE!
1826)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Decades worth of dirt and muck cover the painting. Clearly more than a club soda and salt job.
1827)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I bet old Fisheyes was a hit with the bearded ladies.
1828)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}And how does that make you FEEL?...
1829)  GUYBRUSH
Well, at first I was scared and then I was disappoi... {suspicious}wait you don't care do you?
1830)  MORGAN
{serious}No, not really.
1831)  BUGEYE
Sounds like a fabricated allegation with no basis and zero fact.
1832)  GUYBRUSH
I've got the evidence right here.
1833)  GUYBRUSH
Moist but expedient.
1834)  GUYBRUSH
What happened to Fisheyes Alabaster, again?
1835)  MOOSE
{happy}Some fresh moves {worried}but not enough! Partial originality is as good as none at all! {happy}Bugeye wins!
1836)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Your yes vote was music to my ears.
1837)  MURRAY
{evil}As your screams of horror will be music to mine! {happy}I'll be there, turning the rack myself!
1838)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You got that entire body control thing worked out, huh?
1839)  MURRAY
{worried}I'm working on it.
1840)  MURRAY
{realizing}[Strained] Are my arms moving? I think I heard them move.
1841)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Maybe a little. {embarrassed}Might be the wind.
1842)  MURRAY
{Sad}Ohh...
1843)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I need to infiltrate the Brotherhood and find the missing cochlea.
1844)  MORGAN
{dismissive}Sounds like a personal problem.
1845)  MORGAN
{fierce}ARRR!
1846)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}You got it. Good luck.{suspicious} I've got your six.
1847)  MORGAN
{questioning}[Awk] Thanks...
1848)  GUYBRUSH
Well...{embarrassed}do you think I could have your vote anyway?
1850)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Can I borrow your sword for a minute?
1851)  MORGAN
{Cocky} Just for a minute.
1852)  GUYBRUSH
Here's your sword back.
1853)  MORGAN
{Questioning} Eh, hold onto it.{Cocky} You might need it.
1854)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Bold.
1855)  MORGAN
{Cocky}[Flirty] Oh, I can get it back whenever I want.
1857)  GUYBRUSH
I don't have the dexterity to scrape this filth off with a sword.
1858)  GUYBRUSH
I have a sordid history of destroying art. I need to clean this.
1859)  GUYBRUSH
I don't want to cut that.
1860)  GUYBRUSH
Tearing this to shreds with my new hand won't do me any good.
1861)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I'm going to have to adjust to life with a hook hand. For starters,{suspicious} I shouldn't do that.{default}

[In background, making a huge discovery]{amazed} Sacrebleu! The molecules are synthesizing! The formula is actualizing! Science! I have science here!
1864)  GUYBRUSH
She has such thin wrists. Like a bird. Or a cat burglar.
1865)  GUYBRUSH
I have such fond memories of that blade held to my throat. Those were good times.
1866)  GUYBRUSH
Boots. Presumably made for walking.
1867)  GUYBRUSH
That's no way to wake her up.
1868)  VOODOO
It is said that we are never so vulnerable than when we trust, but paradoxically, if we cannot trust, neither can we find our heart's desire.
1869)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Manatee bile! The ocean's natural solvent.
1870)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I wonder if this will wash off some of this grime.
1871)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Hmm. Not strong enough to cut through the dirt.
1872)  GUYBRUSH
This book is full of gut wrenching torture techniques. Really, there is a device called "the gut wrencher."
1873)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm. The cover is loose.
1874)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Pity it doesn't work that way with people.
1875)  DESINGECUTAWAY
[NO SUBTITLES] [Hushed whisper] La mort est tue... [La mor ay too-ay]

{stern}You talkin' to me?
1877)  BUGEYE
{stern}[Firm] Yes.
1878)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}[He's got nothin] Oh. I uh... [Trail off]
1879)  BUGEYE
{suspicious}Well I'll be. {stern}I've given you all the faces that I know.

1883)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hi, Murray!
1884)  MURRAY
{evil}Threepwood.  {angry}I suppose I should have expected this.
1885)  MURRAY
{angry}Can I interest {evil}YOU in an eternity of painful torment at the hands of the fiery minions of Murray, the invincible demonic skull?
1886)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}Eh, I'm good.
1887)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Diwali!

I don't think these will help De Cava if I puncture them.
1894)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Do you know how hard you've made it to tie my shoes?
1895)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}I'm sorry...but on the bright side it makes you look tough.
1896)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Really? You're not just saying that?{default}
1897)  MORGAN
{serious}No, I am just saying that.{default}
1898)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I need to replace this in the manatee's eustachian passage.{default}
1899)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I don't think this knock-off crown will do anything.{default}
1900)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}This is a potent manatee digestive and should only be used as such.{default}
1901)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}I don't want anything bad to happen to this fish.{default}
1902)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Every grub I waste is one more I'll have to pick up for De Cava.{default}
1903)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I need to hold onto this until I give it to Coronado De Cava.{default}
1904)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I don't see how disseminating inhumane torture acts will do any good.{default}
1905)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}This members manual seems too important for that.{default}
1906)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}This is now the most useless torture manual ever.{default}
1907)  GUYBRUSH
I should be picky about who gets this.
1908)  GUYBRUSH
I don't need to see that any closer. Plus it's specially fit for De Cava.
1909)  GUYBRUSH
A good mug has many uses. This isn't one of them.
1910)  GUYBRUSH
This is volatile bile. I need to be careful with it.
1911)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think a drink will help here.
1912)  MURRAY
What are you doing?!
1913)  GUYBRUSH
I don't know. Experimenting.
1914)  MURRAY
Experiment with something else!
1915)  GUYBRUSH
I'm going to hold on to this fine picture for a bit.
1916)  GUYBRUSH
It's Elaine's wedding ring.
2474)  GUYBRUSH
It's Elaine's wedding ring.
1917)  GUYBRUSH
Elaine was pretty adamant that I take care of this. I should just hold onto it.
1918)  GUYBRUSH
I shouldn't defile this seahorse head any more than I have to.
1919)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think a stomach-turning stench will do any good.
1920)  GUYBRUSH
This is my only way to communicate with giant manatees. I need to keep it safe.
1921)  GUYBRUSH
No bolts to turn here.
1922)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}This is a lot of money! I should think that through.{default}
1923)  GUYBRUSH
If I put him in there, he'll be dead in three seconds. Which WOULD stop his incessant flopping about.
1924)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}I think this part of the manatee has seen enough abuse.
1925)  MOOSE
I just vote for whoever Santino goes in for.
1926)  MOOSE
{stern}We're through the first round!
1927)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Thanks for the vote.
1928)  BUGEYE
{stern}You're not welcome.
1929)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}That way we have an assessment of his reflexes.
1930)  NOOGIE
{suspicious}If things could go well with Morgan, I'd consider it.
1931)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} How do I get to Flotsam Island without BEING on Flotsam Island?
1932)  GUYBRUSH
I need him to teach me how to understand manatee.
1933)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} With what, a rolled up newspaper?
1934)  MURRAY
You don't scare me with your sharp shiny stick, puny mortal!  I am Santino, the incontrovertible demonic skull, and I shall --
1935)  DECAVA
{Enthused} I'm trying to build a replacement inner ear for the manatee but it may take considerably longer without my monocular.
1936)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hey, Moose! Did you know it's Hug An Otter Day?
1937)  MOOSE
{enthused}No way! That deserves a drink!
1938)  GUYBRUSH
We're right on top of La Esponja Grande. De Cava would never let us set sail.
1939)  GUYBRUSH
Bugeye, I thought you swore you'd never serve another tyrant?
1940)  BUGEYE
{default} In light of recent events, I've had a philosophical breakthrough.
1941)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous} But what about Moose and Noogie? Where's--
1942)  MORGAN
{serious} Hey, look at that.
1943)  DECAVA
{cocky}Hahaha! You can't sink a boat made ENTIRELY of rubber trees!
1944)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I'm throwing you overboard.
1945)  MURRAY
Yeah, try it, fumble fingers!
1946)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Zoinks!
1947)  MORGAN
{sarcastic} So what's plan B?
1948)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Very funny.
1949)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised} Now that I think about it... {worried} keeping that seahorse head in my pants the entire time I was underwater {suspicious} probably wasn't the safest course of action. {default}
1950)  GUYBRUSH
De Cava doesn't have any use for that.
1951)  GUYBRUSH
Look, I DO have a wedding ring.
1952)  DECAVA
That you just so happen to not wear? Reeks of suspicion to me...
1953)  GUYBRUSH
I draw the line at actually giving her my wife's wedding ring.
1954)  DECAVA
{stern}No!  First you must throw me La Esponja, then you may sail!
1955)  DECAVA
Oh, all right.
1956)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
Ugh...oof...urggg....
1957)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
I should probably put these cards on the mat in front of me.
1959)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{happy} Excellent!  Run back to your freaky laboratory and fetch it for me.
1960)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{stern} You don't have anything on tape? I need to learn manatee, pronto.
1961)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
I hope this is what I think it is and not what I hope it isn't.
1962)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
A chicken foot back scratcher?
1963)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
It looks familiar...but I just can't put my finger on it.
1964)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY

It's like they tell you on the first day of pirate kindergarten:  you can't stick a square peg leg into a round hole.  Or a square picture, for that matter.

I think the Narwhal's crow's nest will let me access the manatee's sinus area.

1981)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Are we still talking about manatees?
1982)  DECAVA

I need to know where the Tongue of the Manatee is, and you need treasure. {Happy} Let's make this happen.
2029)  BUGEYE

2030)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Why don't you tell me where the Tongue of the Manatee is. {Happy} I've got some treasure to loosen those lips...
2031)  MOOSE
Nah, I don't think so, man.  Me and Santino are hangin' tough.

De Cava's files COULD use more illustrations, but I'd rather keep this picture for my personal files.

{worried}All of that ingestion and digestion has tossed the Tongue of the Manatee into the bile pool... that's a long way down.

{Surprised} I almost forgot!
2047)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} My Pyrite Parrot... I never leave home without it.
2048)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Hmm. It must've been jostled out of my pockets and washed away during ingestion. It's gone forever.
2049)  GUYBRUSH
[underwater] [Sniffs] {cocky}I smell treasure!{default}
2050)  GUYBRUSH
If I take this picture, De Cava will blow a gasket. I'd need to replace it.

2052)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} By ground do you mean bile covered manatee innards?

{Default} It's okay. {Sarcastic} I just hope it hasn't been digested yet.

2058)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
{default} I should mix and match the order of these cards and see what happens.
2059)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
I should get De Singe back here and put the fear of Juju in him.  I need that book.
2060)  GUYBRUSHASVOODOOLADY
My head is full of manatee. Now, there's got to be a way to break this connection...
2061)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You're a tough nut to crack.
2062)  NOOGIE
{Stern} And you're a smelly turncoat.
2063)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Now I know you can't be bribed... which really only leaves one option.

2083)  GUYBRUSH
Where is my sea-creature carcass catapult when I need it?!
2084)  GUYBRUSH
All that time spent teaching my manatee to court a lady would've been better spent training him to attack enemy ships on command.
2085)  GUYBRUSH
Calling a manatee to the rescue is the best idea I've had in minutes...but this won't work above water.
2086)  GUYBRUSH
[Sniffs] The longer this seahorse head is in my pocket, the longer it's going to take to forget the smell.

Inside the beast's mouth, Guybrush met Coronado De Cava, the Voodoo Lady's lost love.  De Cava was infuriated to learn that she and Guybrush had some sort of quest-giving relationship.  To get De Cava's help, Guybrush would have to prove that he's married to another woman.

I understand that you speak the language of giant manatees.
2429)  GUYBRUSH
I feel the urge to do some exploring!
2430)  MANATEE
What do I know about talking to women? One wrong move and my body will feed a family of lobsters for a lifetime.
2431)  
Bugeye was won over when Guybrush pulled out the scariest pirate face ever seen.
2432)  
He swayed Moose by ensuring that his buddy Santino would vote for Guybrush wholeheartedly, or unheartedly as the case may be.
2433)  
His Brotherhood membership secured, Guybrush finally recovered the manatee's missing cochlea.  With that, the manatee would be back on track.
2434)  
Unfortunately, it lay in a cave guarded by the Leviathan... a giant female MANATEE!  To get past her, Guybrush would have to learn how to understand Manatee from someone on Flotsam, and figure out where the crew hid the Tongue of The Manatee so that he could speak it.
2435)  
Using some grade A interrogation techniques, Guybrush learned that the Tongue of the Manatee was, in fact, Moose's old ichor funnel, still back in the manatee's belly.
2436)  
He returned and snagged the Tongue, giving him the ability to speak a limited number of handy travel phrases in Manatee.
2437)  
With the help of the Voodoo Lady's locket, Guybrush found that he could momentarily transport himself back to Flotsam Island, but in her body!
2438)  
He deftly manipulated the Voodoo Lady's cards to convince the Marquis De Singe to give up his book on understanding Manatee.
2439)  
Now that he understood Manatee and possessed the Tongue of the Manatee, Guybrush could finally converse with the giant beasts.  He discovered that to get past the Leviathan, he simply needed to help his manatee find the words to win her over.  How hard could that be?
2440)  
Guybrush returned with La Esponja Grande, only to be re-caged by Coronado De Cava, who promptly sailed away with his prize!
2441)  
When Guybrush got free, he realized that De Cava had left without the sponge.  Unfortunately, so did De Cava, who returned to demand that Guybrush hand it over.  Yet even at the risk of death by cannon fire, our hero could never give up La Esponja Grande...
