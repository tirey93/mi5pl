[pickup1] It's a good thing Elaine gave me her wedding ring until I get my own back... she's so Poxed-out now she'd probably hock it for a keg of grog.

{Happy} All right, Señor Esponja Not-So-Grande, {Cocky} that's five senses down, and one to go!
138)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Now where can I find a really big sound for an after-dinner belch?
139)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} There's only one thing on Flotsam Island that can make a noise like that...
140)  DESINGE
[humming to himself, possibly to the tune of "alouette"]  Alouette, I will live forever, alouette, immortalité...
141)  DESINGE
[continuing to hum] Who will live forever? Moi... Who will conquer nature?  Moi...
142)  ELAINE
Aha!
143)  ELAINE
Arggh!  Face me like a man, ya snuff-sniffin' land-licker!
144)  GUYBRUSH
You heard the lady, De Singe.
145)  ELAINE
[angry] Guybrush!  Get out of here and find your own treasure!  This one's mine!
146)  DESINGE
Ah, the happy Threepwood pirate clan.  [sarcastic]  Whatever shall I do now?  Oh, I know-
147)  GUYBRUSH
Aw, clam dip.
148)  ELAINE
[amused] Hah!  I can't believe I ever married a dullard like you!
149)  GUYBRUSH
Y'know, once I cure you of the Pox that's making you say all these mean things, you're gonna owe me a LOT of smoochies.
150)  ELAINE
[angry] I wouldn't smooch you with HIS lips, cabin boy!
151)  DESINGE
Ahem.  I hate to break up this portrait of domestic bliss, but I've got some last-minute adjustments to make to my machinery before preparing the charming Madame Threepwood for her journey into scientific history--
152)  ELAINE
That's Threepwod-Marley, ya preening ponce!
153)  DESINGE
Yes, well... please try to keep it down, no?
154)  GUYBRUSH
[conspiratorily to Elaine]  Don't worry, buttercup... once I get La Esponja Grande into that noisy doohickey, our troubles will be over!
155)  ELAINE
[angry and poxed and not really paying attention] Argh!
156)  GUYBRUSH
[to himself] At least, I hope so...
157)  DESINGE
[quitely] Eureka...
158)  DESINGE
What's this?  An airborne porifera?
159)  GUYBRUSH
Give that back!
160)  DESINGE
And risk tainting my moment of triumph with your tedious "voodoo" falderal?  I don't think so!
161)  GUYBRUSH
Moment of triumph?
162)  DESINGE
Oui!  Using my Harpsichronitron, I have discovered the unique harmonic frequency that allows me to pulverize matter into a fine powder and spread it across the seas.  Observe!
163)  PARROT
<Bwak!> It's me, Guybrush --!
164)  GUYBRUSH
First of all, thanks.  That thing was really starting to scrape my scabbard.
165)  GUYBRUSH
Second, you're crazy if you think you're going to get me in there.  Okay, crazi-er.
166)  DESINGE
You?  I don't want you!  It's your WIFE'S molecules I need to smear across the seas!
167)  ELAINE
[angry] I'd like to see you try, ya wuss!
168)  GUYBRUSH
Why her?
169)  DESINGE
Because of her Pox, you dolt!  She's got the same unique strain of the Pox that you once had, the same one that was flowing through your amazing hand, the same one that I've distilled into my amazing Jus de Vie!
170)  DESINGE
Unfortunately, a single hand can only provide enough of the "Threepwood Strain" to produce a few meager drams of my Jus de Vie.  Even if I were to drain your beloved to the bone, I would only gain a few piddling firkins of the Jus...
171)  ELAINE
[angry] I'll give you some piddlin' firkins!
172)  GUYBRUSH
Lefty!
173)  DESINGE
[ignoring her]  No, if I want a perpetual strain of the Jus de Vie, every pirate in the world must be exposed to the Threepwood Strain!
174)  DESINGE
Now, Madame Threepwood, if you'll hold still for a moment, I'll try to make this as painless as possible…
175)  ELAINE
[momentarily nice]How nice... [suddenly savage] but I won't!
176)  DESINGE
[reacting to getting stabbed.  Even though he's invulnerable, it hurts.] Ugh!
177)  DESINGE
Heh!  Ha-hah-ha!  Behold the power of the Jus de Vie!
178)  GUYBRUSH
[shocked] What in the name of Bluebeard's hair dye...
179)  DORO
[possessive] Hey, no poaching, I have called dibs!
180)  GUYBRUSH
I think I may be lost... shouldn't there be a creepy voodoo shack right about... there?
181)  DORO
There was... until they came to arrest that Pox-spreading Voodoo Lady.
182)  GUYBRUSH
What happened?
183)  DORO
[haunted] First came the flames... poor Señor Nipperkin went up like Saint Elmo's Fire... then SHE emerged from the conflagration, mumbling ancient curses with every regal step... I'll never forget the baleful stare she fixed me with as she was led away... a look condemning me to a lifetime of suffering, shame, and regret.
184)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Yipes!
185)  GUYBRUSH
Spooky.
186)  DORO
And if that wasn't bad enough, I haven't found ONE bit of cool voodoo stuff in the wreckage!  C'mon!
187)  GUYBRUSH
Mob justice can be SO unfair.
188)  VOODOOLADY
[random under the breath vooodoo curses to play as a sound effect] Enu sanctimus dorimus porumae vitriium, adrio tedium volumae nostirum...
189)  GUYBRUSH
Well, that was a little anticlimact--
190)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly over the wind] Whoa!
191)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly] Oh right, the winds...
192)  ELAINE
[confused and a little angry as the pox is ripped from her] Rarrrrr!
193)  GUYBRUSH
[shouting over the wind]  Hold on!
194)  ELAINE
[as though coming out of a deep sleep] Guybrush?
195)  GUYBRUSH
Elaine!  Are you all right?
196)  ELAINE
I-I think so.  But how'd I get here, and why does my mouth taste like cole slaw?
197)  GUYBRUSH
It's a long story.  I'll tell you all about it once we figure out how to get out of these stupid clamshells.
198)  LECHUCK
Leave everything to me, my friends!
199)  GUYBRUSH
LeChuck!  My new best pal!  How'd you get out of jail?
200)  LECHUCK
[in a casual, matter-of-fact way] Oh, the guard was more than happy to release me once I convinced him that it was the only way to win Elaine's hand in unholy matrimony.
201)  GUYBRUSH
[confused] Wait.  Unholy what?
202)  LECHUCK
Unholy THIS!
203)  ELAINE
[horrified] Guybrush!
204)  GUYBRUSH
[stunned]  Elaine?
205)  ELAINE
GUYBRUSH!!!
206)  LECHUCK
LECHUCK!  [jolly]Arr, this name-shouting is jolly good fun!
207)  GUYBRUSH
[weakly] Is that you, mother?  I washed my hands...
208)  ELAINE
[angry seething] I knew it all along... with or without all that voodoo, you're still nothing but an evil sack of scumm!
209)  LECHUCK
Correction, my sweet... I'm an evil sack of scumm who's about to plunder the grandest treasure in all creation.  But I be willin' to share my booty, if ye catch me drift...
210)  ELAINE
[incredulous] What?
211)  LECHUCK
[charming as hell] Oh come now, my love.  You can't deny what we've shared these past few weeks.  The chummy camaraderie, the kind words, the stolen glances.  I know you've developed feelings for me... join me as my demon bride and together we'll lay a bloody siege to the very heart of voodoo itself!
212)  ELAINE
[seething] Go to hell, LeChuck.
213)  LECHUCK
Well, you can't say I didn't try...
214)  GUYBRUSH
Elaine?
215)  GUYBRUSH
[dying]Do me a favor...
216)  ELAINE
Anything...
217)  GUYBRUSH
[dying] Kick his two-faced butt for me...
218)  ELAINE
[seriously fighting back tears] From Mêlée to Monkey and all the islands in between, my love.
219)  LECHUCKDEMON
Aren't you dead yet?  I've got wedding plans to make!
220)  LECHUCKDEMON
Out of respect for the newly-deceased, I feel I should point out that you wave your sword like a dairy farmer.
221)  ELAINE
[angry] Grrr.
222)  ELAINE
How appropriate... you fight like a Pox-infected undead cow.
223)  LECHUCKDEMON
Bwah-ha-ha-haaaah!
224)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}What the-?
225)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}MORGAN!
226)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}What happened!?
227)  MORGAN
[coughing... she's dying] {strained}Went to get your hand...
228)  GUYBRUSH
{angry}You didn't have to do that!
229)  MORGAN
[coughing... she's dying][trying to get Guybrush's attention] {Serious}Had to pay you back for all the trouble...  Found Jacques...  He told me...
230)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What?
231)  MORGAN
[Slipping away] {strained}He told me...
232)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What?  What did the monkey tell you?
233)  GUYBRUSH
[angrier than he's ever been, ever]{angry} De Singe!
234)  DESINGE
[off-screen and distant] [horrified] Aieee!
235)  GUYBRUSH
What was that?
236)  GUYBRUSH
Hm. Something sure shoved a short sword up his aft sail...
237)  ELAINE
[counting as though working out a treasure map] 18... 19... 20... and X marks the--
238)  ELAINE
[angry] Grr!  When I get me hands on that plaid-coated scallywag, I'm gonna rip off his waving arms and beat him to a briny pulp with 'em!
239)  ELAINE
What're YOU looking at?
240)  DESINGE
The secret to eternal life.
241)  DESINGE
Le Spectre de Grand Caesar!
242)  ELAINE
[piratety] Har-har-harrrrr!
243)  GUYBRUSH
Hm.  Doesn't look like Elaine's in any immediate danger.
244)  DESINGE
[out of breath, breathing heavy]{Worried} At last!  I've lost that she-devil!
245)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Ouch, that's gotta hurt.  {Incredulous} Serves him right, though.
246)  GUYBRUSH
Hopefully, she won't commit any unforgivable atrocities before I finish enlarging my Pox-curing sponge.
247)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Still, I better finish feeding the Sponge before Elaine hurts someone I actually care about.
248)  GUYBRUSH
Now that's an Esponja Grande!  But how will I use it to cure...
249)  LECHUCKDEMON
[in the background]  Arrr, THAT be the stuff...
250)  GUYBRUSH
I don't want to pour acid on that!  It could get scarred or worse... acid-washed!
251)  GUYBRUSH
I'm not sure I want to leak iron all over that.
252)  GUYBRUSH
I'm not sure that would be improved by scattering court papers all over it.
253)  GUYBRUSH
I don't see how that could possibly compare to a sketch of a burned leg.
254)  GUYBRUSH
I don't need a cup of that.
255)  GUYBRUSH
The eye only captures the color of other living eyes.
256)  GUYBRUSH
I don't want to dig my hook into that.... I don't know where it's been.
257)  GUYBRUSH
I don't want to waste my last Blood Island Volcano Shot on that.
258)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think splashing hot wax on that would be productive, fun or pirate-y.
259)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think the garish remnants of Stan's jacket should be tied around THAT.
260)  GUYBRUSH
One thing I've learned the hard way over the years is that you should never pull a monkey out of your pocket until the most dramatically useful moment... and that goes triple for an electromagnetic monkey.
261)  GUYBRUSH
That doesn't need to be illuminated.
262)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think that needs a stinky ol' lion's paw.
263)  GUYBRUSH
Hot manatee oil is a precious resource... I shouldn't splash it around all willy-nilly.
264)  GUYBRUSH
I'm not risking this valuable clue on some half-baked combination scheme!
265)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think I should be splashing molten glass on that.
266)  GUYBRUSH
Something that tasty should be fed to something or someone that really appreciates it.
267)  GUYBRUSH
La Esponja Grande is only good for soaking up voodoo... like the Pox.
268)  GUYBRUSH
La Esponja Grande won't be able to soak up ANYTHING until I finish growing it with the Voodoo Lady's "Feast for the Senses."
269)  DESINGE
{sarcastic}28...29...30 thousand pieces of silver, mon petit chou-chou!
270)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I've got an idea... {confused}why don't you let me go, and I'll pay you {happy}double what the Marquis is paying?
271)  DESINGE
Don't emba{stern}rass yourself, Threepwood.
272)  GUYBRUSH
Back on the Narwhal, I've got an entire kitty full of cold, hard...IOUs.
273)  GUYBRUSH
I'll auction off my entire collection of autographed sextants.
274)  GUYBRUSH
Oh yeah? I'll pay Triple!
275)  DESINGE
{Arrogant}HA!
276)  GUYBRUSH
Quadruple?
277)  GUYBRUSH
Quintuple?
278)  GUYBRUSH
Sextuple?
279)  DESINGE
[Creepy, sexual titter.]
280)  DESINGE
{happy}Ah, {sarcastic}Threepwood, you grossly underestimate the value of that which {stern}courses through your body!
281)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Oh, I've got a pretty good idea. {cocky}Why, my spit alone once won me 8,000 pieces of eight on Booty Island--
282)  DESINGE
{sarcastic}[Interrupting] Then you shall die knowing that you gave a priceless gift {happy}to science!
283)  MORGAN
{terrified}[Quiet, to Guybrush] I'm sorry.
284)  DESINGE
{amazed}Finally!  I've got the Threepwood, I've got the formula, {happy}and soon I'll have nothing less than life eternal! {happy} I'm as happy as a penguin sliding on its belly!
285)  DESINGE
{angry}What is this?
286)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Aw, it's a welcome back party! {happy}I hope they brought ice cream cake...
287)  MCGEE
{stern}GUYBRUSH THREEPWOOD, we've been waiting a long time for this!
288)  DESINGE
{confused}What!?  {worried}No!!! Come back!
289)  MCGEE
{angry}[To Desinge] This cracker-croaker's got a date in the court of pirate law, {stern}ya test-tube-tinkerin' Talleyrand!
290)  DESINGE

291)  KREBBS
{annoyed}And then the scurvy dog'll hang!
292)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}What the-!?
293)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[Realizing] Ahh...{happy}LADIES' night.
294)  MORGAN
{strained}Guybrush! Your wife has lost her mind!
295)  ELAINE
{evil}[Poxy] And yer about to lose a limb ya sea cow!
296)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Elaine, sugarcakes, {incredulous}let's stop fighting and work this out over a nice cold lite grog.
297)  ELAINE
[Poxy] It's her head or yours, bilge-boy.{guybrush surprised}
298)  GUYBRUSH
OR you two {confused}can just figure out this little misunderstanding on your own. I'll be over here appreciating my head's ability to {worried}stay attached to my neck.
299)  ELAINE

{cocky}Honey, you are formally summoned to appear before the court of Judge Grindstump in the case of the People of Flotsam v. {proud}Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™.
304)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}[Out of breath] Phew… now I know who wears the daddy pants in the relationship.
305)  ELAINE
You stay away from my boy's pants or I'll hang ya from my Jolly Roger ya jezebel!
306)  ELAINE
And you! Don't think you can totter around with some tart and not get a fist-full of-
307)  MORGAN
She's a catch.
308)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}And conveniently, {stern}not a rotten double-crosser.
309)  MORGAN
{stern}I told you I had a job to do.
310)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}SURE just doing your job - {incredulous}tell me, aside from all the silver, {stern}how are the benefits?
311)  MORGAN
{sad}Guybrush-
312)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Do you get health care for the repetitive stress injuries caused by all {stern}the back-stabbing and CUTTING OFF PEOPLE'S HANDS?
313)  MORGAN
[Sincere. Hurt.] I said I was sorry.
314)  GUYBRUSH
Sorry?  {angry}I can't pick my left nostril without risking a lobotomy!
315)  MORGAN
{terrified}What if I--
316)  GUYBRUSH
[Interrupting] What if nothing! {stern}Goodbye Morgan. I've got a wife to cure and an island to save.
317)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Ah, Club 41. Nothing screams {cocky}"pirate bar" like the aroma of moldy Grog sprinkled with just a hint of {suspicious}sea spray and shattered dreams…
318)  DESINGE
I will double your quadrupled rate!
319)  MORGAN
{stern}Keep your gold, silkpants.  {strained}You can't afford me anymore.
320)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[Offended] Hey!
321)  MORGAN
{strained}What part of "non" [i.e. French for "no"] {disgusted}do you not comprendez?
322)  DESINGE
[Whiney] But I NEED her! She is the only other pirate who could possibly have the Threepwood Strain of the Pox!!
323)  MORGAN
{strained}Then get her yourself.
324)  DESINGE
[Threatening]My dear mademoiselle LeFlay, I don't "get" people, I hire people like YOU to get them for me.  And if YOU won't get them, then maybe I'll find someone to get YOU-
325)  MORGAN
{stern}I don't LIKE{strained} to be threatened.
326)  DESINGE
YEEEEOWWWWWWW! My phalangeeeee!
327)  MORGAN
{terrified}What the?
328)  DESINGE
OWWWWWW! [coldly] That was a very, VERY bad mistake, mademoiselle.
329)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Your honor. Buccaneers of Flotsam. You all believe that I, {Proud} Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™, {Default} have brought this horrible Pox to your shores.

{Incredulous} What if I were to tell you that I could tame this unruly witness, {Cocky} prove my good intentions, {Sarcastic} and begin the process of curing you all of this hideous Voodoo Pox all in one fell swoop?
334)  GALLERY1
…that's not so bad...
335)  GALLERY2
I don't know...maybe......
336)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Denied!  But get on with it, Captain. The hangman gets overtime if we keep him up after midnight.
337)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} With pleasure, Your Honor. Wenches and Pirates, I give you exhibit S, the wonder of La Esponja Grande!
338)  MCGEE
I thought it'd be bigger.
339)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Now behold, as a simple exfoliating motion of La Esponja Grande washes away the Pox , restoring my wife to her usual, mostly-pleasant demeanor!
340)  ELAINE
[Poxy]{Angry}  Get that piece'a seaweed off me ya deepsea doily diver!
341)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uh...
342)  GRINDSTUMP
{Sarcastic} Does the defense have any other pointless arguments it would like to make?
343)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uh...{Embarrassed} this is sort of all I got.
344)  GRINDSTUMP
{Default} Then by the power vested in me by the put-upon pirates of Flotsam Island, {Stern} I summarily sentence you to be hanged by your Pox-spreading neck until you are-
345)  LECHUCK
{Proud} Hold it right there!
346)  GUYBRUSH
[Surprise] {Surprised} What?
347)  GALLERY1
LeChuck? I thought he was a ghost?
348)  GALLERY2
I heard he was a zombie.
349)  KREBBS
{Sarcastic} Woof!
350)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} What is the meaning of this?!
351)  LECHUCK
{Stern} My name is LeChuck and I can tell you exactly what Guybrush did!
352)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Don't listen to him!
353)  LECHUCK
{Pleading} You see, your honor, the Pox is all my fault!
354)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Listen to him!
355)  LECHUCK
{Concerned} For decades I dabbled in the dark forces of Voodoo, clamoring for power. {Stern} I hungered for it. {Awe} I yearned for it. {Pleading} I pillaged, plundered, and killed for it.
356)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I can attest to all of this.
357)  LECHUCK
{Humble} And it was my accumulated Voodoo that infected you all! {Frustrated} Dark evil vooodoo that was {Default} explosively released when I was once again defeated by the {Humble} perpetually heroic Guybrush Threepwood.
358)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} He's not kidding... {Sarcastic} I've killed him like five times.
359)  LECHUCK
{Concerned} So you see, Guybrush Threepwood is not the source of this Pox.  {Humble} I am!  And I hereby throw myself {Pleading} upon the mercy of this court, or lack thereof!
360)  LECHUCK
{Default} It turns out I had an unknown, {Frustrated} silent power urging me down those {Concerned} darkened voodoo corridors, {Disappointed} a power far more insidious than I could ever hope to be. {Stern} I submit, to the court. This journal!
361)  LECHUCK
{Default} Property of...
362)  LECHUCK
The…
363)  GRINDSTUMP
{Angry} Quiet up there!
364)  LECHUCK
{Shocked} The Voodoo Lady!
365)  GALLERY3
Who!?
366)  STAN
{Confused} That creepy lady who lives in the shack?!
367)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What the what?!
368)  LECHUCK
{Default} In these pages you will find detailed plans, laid out by the Voodoo Lady over the course of many years, {Disappointed} to manipulate my never-ending rise to power.  {Concerned} My hunger for Voodoo. {Embarrassed} My seemingly endless cycle of ironically comical death and disturbing resurrection.  {Happy} My obsession with the darling Elaine.  {Default} It's all because of her.
369)  KREBBS
Off with her head!
370)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} This can't be true...{Confused} can it?
371)  GRINDSTUMP
{Angry} Order! Order! {Stern} I  hereby call for the release of Guybrush Threepwood and the immediate imprisonment of LeChuck and the Voodoo Lady. {Angry} To the brig with both of 'em!
372)  GUYBRUSH
[To Elaine] {Happy} Sugarcakes!
373)  ELAINE
{Stern} I've had it up to me eyepatch with all this {Angry} land-lubbing-lollygaggin! {Devilish} I'm off to plunder me some treasure!
374)  LECHUCK
[To Guybrush]{Humble} Don't worry about me, my friend.  Go cure your wife!
375)  GRINDSTUMP
{Thinking} Let's see here...cleared...dropped...hmm...yes. {Happy} Congratulations, Captain Threepwood, it appears that you've successfully gotten yourself out from under your various civil charges...
376)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Shiver me timbers, Stumpy. {Cocky} I guess I'll be going now.
377)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Huh?!? Assault with molten nacho cheese isn't criminal?! {Default} What else is there?
378)  GRINDSTUMP
{Default} The "creation, incubation, dissemination, proliferation and mastication of a Pox or Pox-like affliction." {Stern} A class one felonious act here on Flotsam.
379)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} How do you plead?
380)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} Well, Threepwood?  {Stern} Do you have any witnesses to your unlikely tale?
381)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I do! {Worried} She's--
382)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Plunder bunny!
383)  ELAINE
[Poxy] {Angry} Arrr! {Devilish} Avast ye blubberin belugas! I'm sacking yer port! Bring me all ye spoils, swags, booty and boodle!
384)  GUYBRUSH
[Nervous, talking out of the corner of his mouth, sing-songy almost] {Worried} Eeeelaine... {Sarcastic} less plunder, {Confused} more bunny please.
385)  ELAINE
[Still Poxy] {Devilish} And YOU! [Now in LOVE with Guybrush] {Babying} Me bonnie lass! {Happy} Step into me captain's quarters and let {Devilish} me ravish you silly!
386)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Whoa boy!
387)  ELAINE
[Poxy, melodramatic romance]{Happy} Arr, to finally hold you in me arms again, {Devilish} it makes me want to...[Trails off catching a whiff of something]
388)  ELAINE
{Exasperated} What's this? {Horrified} The scent of betrayal! {Angry} Who is this tawdry wench?!?
389)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Nobody! {Scared} No one!
390)  ELAINE
{Angry} She'll die by me rusty blade!
391)  GUYBRUSH
[Sigh] {Suspicious} There goes my witness.
392)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Then she must be summoned! {Default} Bailiff! Serve the woman immediately.
393)  HARDTACK
{Default} Yes sir!
394)  GRINDSTUMP
{Default} You'd better be usin' the Voodoo summons… that {Sarcastic} saucy sea-hag doesn't look like she be {Stern} respecting the customs of pirate law.
395)  HARDTACK
Aye-aye, sir!
396)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} But first, haul the defendant's Pox-spreading keister back to the brig!
397)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Guilty!
398)  GRINDSTUMP
{Sarcastic} Is that so?
399)  GUYBRUSH
Is the mandatory sentence a {Cocky} slap on the bottom and a public shaming?
400)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} Let's see here...{Stern} no. It's death.
401)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Oh.  Then not guilty.
402)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} On what grounds?
403)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Not guilty!
404)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} There is no Pox! {Incredulous} Everyone's just got the mumps.
405)  GUYBRUSH
[Awkward eh] {Embarrassed} Er...
406)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} I may have aided in its creation, incubation, dissemination and proliferation, {Confused} but mastication? {Stern} That doesn't even make sense!
407)  GRINDSTUMP
[angry] {Stern} Are you suggestioning that this court doesn't know the meaning of the words it uses?
408)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} The Pox isn't so bad. {Happy} Everyone's tough as nails now and can do {Cocky} neato demon things with their eyes!
409)  GALLERY2
It's evil!
410)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} The Pox isn't {Stern} MY fault!  {Worried} It's LeChuck's!  {Incredulous} It all started with the Cursed Cutlass of Kaflu, {Confused} off the Rock of Gelato.  {Suspicious} LeChuck was doing something evil with monkeys, and I was all {Stern} "grrrr." {Worried} But then LeChuck broke my root beer bottle, {Cocky} and I had to substitute some of the Voodoo Lady's ingredients, {Confused} and then LeChuck turned into a human and all his voodoo went {Surprised} "booOOOom" and...
411)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think leaving the summons there will do any good.
412)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think that needs its fortune told.
413)  GUYBRUSH
It's a cup of scalding science fluid.
414)  GUYBRUSH
It's a broken "Draw a Beard on Guybrush" toy
415)  GUYBRUSH
Hm. looks like it's leaking iron fillings.
416)  GUYBRUSH
It's a broken toy that's leaking iron flakes.
417)  GUYBRUSH
Icky.
418)  GUYBRUSH
Hard to believe that nacho sauce could do that.
419)  GUYBRUSH
It's an insulated cup that Club 41 uses to serves its Blood Island Volcano Shots.
420)  GUYBRUSH
I'll have to get it to look at someone else's eye before it takes on a color.
421)  GUYBRUSH
Nice looking, but not exactly "wow."
422)  GUYBRUSH
That eye color doesn't really impress me.
423)  GUYBRUSH
That's one creepy Pox-filled eye.
424)  GUYBRUSH
I wonder whatever happened to my hand.  I hope it's happy.
425)  GUYBRUSH
It's an esophagus-scarring Blood Island Volcano Shot.
426)  GUYBRUSH
It's a cup of bubbling hot wax.
427)  GUYBRUSH
Even though it's been reduced to rags, Stan's jacket is still a sight to make eyes sore.
428)  GUYBRUSH
[singing a familiar song] Oh there's a monkey in my pocket, he's attracting all my change, his tail is a magnet, and I think that he's got mange...
429)  GUYBRUSH
I'm never going to attract any Jungle Fireflies out here in the Not-Jungle.
430)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm.
431)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm.  That looks familiar.
432)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm.  I wonder how that compares to Kathryn's burn?
433)  GUYBRUSH
It's a sack full of severed legs... [shudder]
434)  GUYBRUSH
That lion's paw stinks worse than my mother-in-law's neck folds.
435)  GUYBRUSH
[singing] In the jungle, the pirate jungle, the lion stinks on ice...
436)  GUYBRUSH
I hope this bubbling manatee oil was harvested humanely.
437)  GUYBRUSH
Hey, neat, there's a map of the Flotsam Jungle on the cover!
438)  GUYBRUSH
No more listening to bees and birds and boars for THIS Mighty Pirate™!
439)  GUYBRUSH
It's molten glass... inside a glass.  Trippy.
440)  GUYBRUSH
Just LOOKING at that thing makes my tongue burn.
441)  GUYBRUSH
[sarcastic] "La Esponja Grande" has turned out to be "La Esponja Lame-o."
442)  GUYBRUSH
Looks like I'm gonna have to give this mini-sponge a "Feast for the Senses" before he'll suck up any more Pox.
443)  GUYBRUSH
It's all dressed up and ready to eat!
444)  GUYBRUSH
I'd pull the bone out of there, but I might lose my other hand.
445)  GUYBRUSH
Hot, stinky, and bad for the eyes is no way to go through life, Sponge.
446)  GUYBRUSH
I wonder if La Esponja Grande can sense the future now?  And how would it tell anyone if it did?
447)  GUYBRUSH
Now all I've got to do is find a big, belchy sound, and La Esponja Grande'll be as good as grown!
448)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly] Looks like all I have to do now is plunk La Esponja Grande into the noisy Vaycaylian Wind Control Device!
449)  GUYBRUSH
This thing's gonna have to get a lot bigger to soak up all of Elaine's Pox.
450)  GUYBRUSH
Good ol' C-Twelve, H-Twenty-Two, O-Eleven, just like Mamma Threepwood used to make.
451)  GUYBRUSH
The only way to drag Elaine into court is to get this Voodoo summons into her hands!
452)  GUYBRUSH
Looks like there's few cards missing, but I'm sure there's enough precognitive mojo in these babies to count as a "Sixth Sense" course.
453)  GUYBRUSH
Whoa, that's one powerful magnetic monkey tail!
454)  GUYBRUSH
That's strange... I could've sworn Jacques' eyes used to be a green, icky, hypnotized kind of color.
455)  GUYBRUSH
They say that monkey eyes are 99.5% the same as human eyes...
456)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, no match here.
457)  GUYBRUSH
Bingo!
458)  GUYBRUSH
Looks like Captain Kathryn's case is nacho good, after all... [yeaaaaaaaah!]
459)  GUYBRUSH
There's nothing in the cup to splash on the leg.
460)  GUYBRUSH
Y'know, when I dreamed of becoming a Mighty Pirate™, I never imagined that one day I'd be tying eye-popping napkins around the non-existent necks of mystical sponges.
461)  GUYBRUSH
C'mon little Sponge, eat the nice smelly antepawsta...
462)  GUYBRUSH
[encouraging, as though to a baby] That's a good Sponge.
463)  GUYBRUSH
It's a good thing the Sponge doesn't have a tongue, or I'd be dunking it in the ocean right about now.
464)  GUYBRUSH
Hopefully, these flakes of the future will give La Esponja a sixth sense that'll help keep me from getting into situations like this.
465)  GUYBRUSH
[Greeting] {Happy} LeChuck!
466)  LECHUCK
[Greeting] {Happy} Guybrush!
467)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Really, thanks again.
468)  LECHUCK
{Happy} You don't need to thank me, my friend. I merely spoke the truth.  They say that truth is the greatest barnacle scrubber, you know.
469)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Nice to the see that nothing's altered the altar while I've been away.
470)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} I bet that's the "Sacrificial Altar of the Jungle Beast" that Hemlock was rambling about.
471)  GUYBRUSH
[smelling something bad]{Disgust} Whew, that altar reeks!
472)  GUYBRUSH
It smells worse than the sofa bed {Incredulous} after Elaine's mom has dropped by for a visit!
473)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Now that I know a little bit more about the Vaycaylians, it appears that we're nearing the end of the {Incredulous} Year of the Fish, and approaching the dawn of the Year of the Slightly Bigger Fish.
474)  GUYBRUSH
{worried} The poor little flesh-eating stink bomb looks like he's in a world of pain.
475)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Those jaws'll snap me twain if I get too close, or maybe even thwain!
476)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} It's the Mysterious Chest of Foreshadowing from the Voodoo Lady's shack! {Incredulous} Who knows what sort of useful voodoo bric-a-brac lurk in its locked timbers?
477)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Even more importantly, how am I gonna unlock it to find out?
478)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What the heck is THAT thing supposed to do?
479)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} This is  my Harpsichronitron, which I can use to remotely manipulate the Vaycaylians' Wind Control Device without all that {Sarcastic} tedious mucking about in the jungle with ancient idols!
480)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I can't say's I blame you... all that running and spinning and weather vaning DID get on my nerves after a while.
481)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} De Singe is using that mutant harpsichord to manipulate the Vaycaylian's Wind Control device.
482)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I would've bet my good hand that I'd never say this, but...{Happy} thank you.
483)  LECHUCK
{Confused} For what?{Embarrassed} I've caused you nothing but despair!
484)  GUYBRUSH
For taking the fall back there. And for exposing the Voodoo Lady. {Confused} I don't know what to make of any of it, {Happy}but now I can focus on saving Elaine and dealing with the Pox.
485)  LECHUCK
{Humble} It is the very least I could do. But be careful, Guybrush.
486)  GUYBRUSH
{Proud} I'm always careful.
487)  LECHUCK
[Friendly, sarcastic]{SeriousThinking} This from the guy who proposed to his wife with a cursed engagement ring you stole from MY hold?...
488)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Was that a dig?{Incredulous} Is the evil Demon Pirate LeChuck developing a{Happy} sense of humor?
489)  GUYBRUSH
[Becoming friends with LeChuck]{Suspicious} This is weird.
490)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Where have you been?{Suspicious} I thought you were with Elaine!
491)  LECHUCK
{SeriousThinking} Well, after leaving Spinner Cay, Elaine and I set out to finish releasing all those monkeys I'd captured. After we were finished releasing the last of them, Elaine caught wind of your trial,{Shocked} went into a Poxed rage, seized a passing clam schooner, and made a beeline for Flotsam Island.
492)  GUYBRUSH
{Proud} That's my girl...
493)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} It's amazing how easily man-eating tribes can be reasoned with.
494)  LECHUCK
{Worried} Knowing I needed to get here more than ever, I lashed together a few bits of cannibal leftovers and warthog sinew to build a makeshift raft. {Frustrated} Unfortunately that was soon eaten by the sharks...
495)  GUYBRUSH
[Rapt, listening to LeChuck's story]{Surprised} Oh no.
496)  LECHUCK
{Excited} So I swam. I swam as fast as I could for three days.
497)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} And arrived just in time to save me from the gallows. Nicely done, buddy.
498)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Kudos to your swim instructor.
499)  LECHUCK
{Happy} I was fueled by the fire of our budding friendship!
500)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Have you seen Elaine?
501)  LECHUCK
{Worried} No, not since she left me in a Poxed rage.
502)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} She's been doing a lot of that lately.
503)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} So, you haven't seen Elaine then?
504)  LECHUCK
{Disappointed} I'm afraid not. She's quite a handful.
505)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} You're telling me.{Happy} All those thwarted attempts to marry her might have been blessings in disguise, huh?
506)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} De Singe is going to use that contraption to pulverize my sweet patootie!
507)  GUYBRUSH
[as though narrating a nature special] {Suspicious} "The mighty pirate hunter tracks his prey via his distinctive firefly-attracting spoor..."
508)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Those fireflies are so pretty, {Incredulous} it almost makes you forget they spend half their lives as maggots.
509)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} What have you done to my hand, De Jerk [pronounced "Zherk"].
510)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} You hand is attached to my Transdermic Intraveneous Turbo Turban, {Happy} which holds it in place while a delicate series of tubes distills its amazing Pox into my death-defying Jus de Vie!
511)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Uhhh...
512)  DESINGE
[rolling his eyes, domubing it down] {Angry} It's a hat that's sucking the life out of your hand.
513)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ohhhh.  {Confused} That's bad, then.
514)  DESINGE
{Sarcastic} For your hand, yes.  {Happy} Por moi, it's spectacular!
515)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} So, why a turban? {Incredulous} It's not very French.
516)  DESINGE
{Confused} What in ze world gave you zee ridiculous idea zat I was French?
517)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} But, um... never mind.
518)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} I can't believe the Voodoo Lady has been pulling your ghostly/demonic strings all these years.
519)  LECHUCK
{Exasperated} It came as a shock to me, as well. {SeriousThinking} But her diary spells it all out.  You, me, Elaine... we're all part of the Voodoo Lady's malevolent plans.
520)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} Malevolence is in the eye of the beholder, Guybrush Threepwood.
521)  VOODOOLADY
{Default} I know this is difficult to understand, but things are not as they seem.
522)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} No... things seem remarkably convoluted, which is what I've come to expect from you.
523)  LECHUCK
{Stern} Well, what about MY interests? Without your meddling, I could have lived a normal, happy, pirate's life!
524)  VOODOOLADY
{Angry} Hah!  The destiny of LeChuck has NEVER been "normal."
525)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} How about the mountain of ice on the rollercoaster of the damned?  She was behind THAT?
526)  LECHUCK
{Awe} ESPECIALLY that.
527)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} That's weird.  This whole idol is under one of Crimpdigit's unbreakable glass bottles.
528)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I assume that these "idols-under-glass" are your doing?
529)  DESINGE
{Happy} Oui!  Using a complex series of powerful unbreakable vacuum tubes and my own incredible machinery, {Arrogant} I've centralized the control of the Vaycaylian Wind Control Device to this relatively compact Harspichronitron.
530)  GUYBRUSH
I didn't think it was possible, but De Singe has LITERALLY made the Vaycaylians's Wind Control Machine suck even more than it did before!
531)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} I risked life, limb and manatee to get La Esponja Grande and it's a puny, worthless lump.
532)  LECHUCK
{Confused} What?
533)  GUYBRUSH
{Default}[Deadpan] Soak up the gargantuan wonder that is La Esponja Grande.
534)  LECHUCK
{Shocked} That is La Esponja Grande?{Pleading} But wasn't it supposed to hold INFINITE amounts of Voodoo?
535)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I know. {Incredulous} What a crock.
536)  VOODOOLADY
[Offscreen] The size of the sponge is meaningless.  It is what you DO with it that matters.
537)  LECHUCK
{Stern} Oh yeah, well you fight like a... uh...
538)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Oh yeah, well you fight like a... uh...
539)  LECHUCK
{Happy} Teehee!
540)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Teehee!
541)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} The sponge is still small.
542)  LECHUCK
{SeriousThinking} Most unfortunate!
543)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious} I wonder who put this idol under glass, and why?
544)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} So Miss Spookypants gave me this menu which will supposedly put more Grande in my Esponja.
545)  LECHUCK
{Happy} Excellent!
546)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} You want to put some of your new-found deductive reasoning to the test and help me figure out what I need for the menu?
547)  LECHUCK
{Humble} I'd give my beard to be able to help you,{Disappointed} but I'm afraid my pirate mind is not fit for such things.
548)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Which explains why after all these years you've still allowed me to get within a nautical mile of you with a bottle of voodoo root beer.
549)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Got any deep thoughts about this voodoo menu?
550)  LECHUCK
{Disappointed} I'm afraid I'm useless here, Guybrush.
551)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Sit tight, buddy.  Once I save Elaine, you're next.
552)  LECHUCK
{Proud} Don't worry about me!
553)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Hey! You!
554)  VOODOOLADY
Hello, Threepwood.
555)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry}[Perturbed] Hey! You! Again!
556)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Oh look at that... the poor hideous flesh-eating plant has a smelly rotting lion's paw caught in its teeth, er, thorns.
557)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Hold still little buddy, I'll get that nasty ol' hunk of meat out for--
558)  GUYBRUSH
{Scared} Yipes!
559)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} C'mon, plant, fork over that paw...
560)  GUYBRUSH
{stern} I'll never get my hands on that super-stinky paw while that "mouth" is snapping at me.
561)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Don't worry, you freakish little abomination, Doctor Guybrush will make it all better.
562)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Gotcha!
563)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} Pee-yoo!  That is by FAR the foulest thing I've ever smelled in all my years of pirating... and that's coming from a guy who's just spent a few days inside a giant manatee!
564)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You've been lying to me about LeChuck all these years!
565)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} My ways are my own, Guybrush, but rest assured,{Default} I have never lied to you.
566)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You're lying right now! {Incredulous} All this time I thought LeChuck was an inhuman monster...{Confused} well, actually he was an inhuman monster,{Stern} but only because you MADE him that way!
567)  VOODOOLADY
{Surprised} Did I? {Mystical} Or was I merely playing my role in a much larger play?
568)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Stop trying to confuse me! We're tired of being puppets in your chess game!
569)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern}[dire, voice raising] This is no game, Threepwood!
570)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You corrupted LeChuck and sent him out to torment me and Elaine for years!{Angry} I'll never trust you again.
571)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern} I don't require your trust, Threepwood... only your... {Mystical}heroism.
572)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Looks like the ol' Vaycaylian Wind Control Device has been set to "suck" again. {Confused} But what's all that tubing around its "fingers" all about?
573)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Looks like someone's been messing with the Vaycaylian Wind Control Device.  And by "someone" I mean the Marquis De Singe. {Angry} And by "the Marquis De Singe" I mean "the incredible pain in my fundament."
574)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Whatever De Singe is doing to the Vaycaylian Wind Control Device, it can't be good.
575)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised}Somehow De Singe has figured out how to make the Vaycaylian Wind Device pulverize people (and annoying parrots) into a fine powder.  {Confused} That's just plain weird.
576)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Hm.  Looks like the light of the shack's embers has attracted a swarm of jungle moths.
577)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I'd better keep away from them, or they'll strip me naked faster than you can say "MA Rating."
578)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You sent me on a wild albatross chase for La Esponja Grande, and promised me it would cure the Pox.  But after fending off  sexually ambiguous merpeople, a giant manatee,{Angry} and your crazy ex-boyfriend, what do I get for my trouble?{Incredulous} THIS sorry excuse for a kitchen sponge!
579)  VOODOOLADY
[amazed]{Happy} La Esponja.
580)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Ah I noticed you strategically left out the "Grande" from this worthless piece of junk.{Incredulous} Once it cured my piddly leftover Pox,{Stern} it didn't have enough mojo left to cure Elaine.
581)  VOODOOLADY
{Default}It's not worthless, it is merely.. young.{Mystical} It must be brought to maturity in order to reach it's voodoo-absorbing potential.
582)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Brought to maturity? {Suspicious} How'm I supposed to do that,{Incredulous} give it a talk about the Sponge Birds and Sponge Bees?
583)  VOODOOLADY
{Default} Like all infants, La Esponja needs nourishment.{Mystical} It must be fed six special voodoo courses to bring it to adult size.
584)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What sort of meal is THAT?
585)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} A Feast for the Senses.
586)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern} The menu, Threepwood. Take it,{Happy} and serve the sponge a meal unlike any other.
587)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} And then?
588)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} It will grow.
589)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} About this "Feast for the Senses..."
590)  VOODOOLADY
What would you like to know?
591)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Those clothes-munching moths must be attracted to the glowing lights of the Wind Machine's eyes.
592)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy}Hey, it's the moths!{incredulous}  I bet they're still punch-drunk off of Stan's funky fashions.
593)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's that?
594)  DESINGE
[dryly]{Arrogant} That... is a bucket of water.
595)  GUYBRUSH
[impersonating De Singe] {Proud} Zat... ees a bucket of water.
596)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Mmm, sugar water.
597)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} I can't believe that stupid parrot somehow found its way back into my life.
598)  PARROT
<bwak!> It's me, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™!
599)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Aw, I can't stay mad at you...
600)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think that's opening up without one of those seahorse key thingies.  {Whiney} Too bad I lost mine.
601)  GUYBRUSH
Even when it's burned to the ground, the Voodoo Lady's shack is STILL creepy.
602)  GUYBRUSH
I met Coronado DeCava.
603)  VOODOOLADY
{Happy} My beloved! How was he?
604)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Mad. Bipolar. Life ruined.{Stern} Just another pawn sacrificed in your theater of the damned.
605)  VOODOOLADY
{Default} I never meant to cause him harm.
606)  GUYBRUSH
Sure you didn't.
607)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} C'mon, admit it. {Incredulous} You were manipulating Coronado.
608)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern} Coronado was never touched by my Voodoo...{Happy} even though he sometimes begged to be.
609)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, so I'll just shut up.
610)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Have you seen Elaine?{Incredulous} Of course, even if you have, I won't believe you.
611)  VOODOOLADY
So whether I have or have not, does not matter.
612)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Well, if you do, tell LeChuck and then have him tell me.
613)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} So, when I was with De Cava...you might have felt something...{Confused} "strange" happen.
614)  VOODOOLADY
Ah.  You are no doubt alluding to your brief possession of my physical form.
615)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Ha! {Cocky} How did it feel to be the manipulated instead of the manipulator for once?
616)  VOODOOLADY
It was...{Happy} curiously liberating.
617)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I bet the Marquis thinks you have the hots for him now.
618)  VOODOOLADY
Tell me, did you ever consider where{Stern} MY consciousness traveled to when you replaced it with yours?
619)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused}[Thinking... scared] ...N-N-No.
620)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Try not to get executed before I cure Elaine.
621)  VOODOOLADY
As you wish.
622)  GUYBRUSH
The tide must be high, I can almost reach down and touch the well water.
623)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Wishing well on jungle floor, who's the pirate most adored?
624)  ELAINE
{Serious} What the-?
625)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Freaky.
626)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I hope all this sugar water doesn't rot out the Flotsamites' teeth... {incredulous} what's left of them, anyway.
627)  GUYBRUSH
The first course in the Feast of the Senses -- the napkin.{Confused} What's up with that?
628)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} The table must be set with an eye-catching napkin. To entice the sponge's hunger...
629)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Tell me about the Napkin again.
630)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} The Feast must begin with a cloth of such stunning visual stimulation that the sponge will have no choice but to dine.
631)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Let's see, what do I have now that I DIDN'T have the last time I tried to open this chest...
632)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Ow!  Stupid hook!
633)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Oh, it can't be THAT easy.
634)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} The Voodoo Lady's tarot cards?  That's it? {Angry} I bent the fabric of reality for a stupid fortune teller's trick?
635)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Okay, that's a pretty good trick.
636)  GUYBRUSH
My hook won't reach him from here.
637)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Hey, De Barge!
638)  DESINGE
{Worried} Ack!
639)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} What the -?
640)  DESINGE
{Amazed} SCIENCE!
641)  GUYBRUSH
I think we've established that that won't do any good.
642)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} My hand's already got its hand full.
643)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} I haven't got it in me to kill this miserable, flesh-rending plant-creature-thing.
644)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I can't reach it from here, and even if I could, I don't think it would do any good.
645)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} That's one lock my hook WON'T be unlocking.
646)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} The antepasta?{Incredulous} Explain.
647)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} With the table set, a powerful aroma must encourage the appetite to grow.
648)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} I think my nose has been in shock since traversing the inside of a manatee.
649)  VOODOOLADY
{Default} I'm sure you will find something.
650)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious}Can you give me any more insight about the antepasta?
651)  VOODOOLADY
I can't say what exactly would be appropriate for the Feast of the Senses.{Happy} Fetid sweet meats perhaps. Dry aged, deep within the jungle. Something of that nature.
652)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}[Sarcastic] Appetizing.
653)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I don't know about mythical jungle beasts, but I always prefer MY ritual sacrifices to be slathered in sugar water.
654)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Can you tell me about the palate cleanser?
655)  VOODOOLADY
Before the main course, the palate must be scalded clean by a powerful taste!
656)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Ooh! Like grog?!
657)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern} No, not at all like grog.
658)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Palate cleanser...Hmm...
659)  VOODOOLADY
Something of such grand flavor as to send the senses back to square one.
660)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Big flavor.{Cocky} Got it.
661)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} It says here that course four, the main course, is the "sixth" sense.{Confused} That doesn't even MAKE sense.
662)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Whoa.
663)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uh-oh.
664)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Hmm.  Looks like these finicky moths {Incredulous} won't eat a jacket that's encrusted with bacon grease, fishwater, and manatee guts.  Lucky me.
665)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} "We replaced our usual fleshy sacrifice with a clever simulacrum...{Incredulous} let's see if the jungle gods notice."
666)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Wet meat.  It's what's for dinner.
667)  VOODOOLADY
{Happy} Ah, but it does. [make sense]{Mystical} For where the other five senses are limited to the finite experiences of the present, the sixth sense satiates the appetite for the infinite possibilities of the future!
668)  GUYBRUSH
The future?  How do I feed something the future?
669)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} This sixth sense business is all pretty abstract.
670)  VOODOOLADY
You must find something that will allow the Sponge to sense the future. As I said, you already possess the key to finding it.
671)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Your hut is nothing more than a smoldering pile of rubble!
672)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern} Yes, a destruction of my own doing.
673)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} But you had so much neat stuff! The Chest of Foreshadowing! Your creepy rug!  All those skulls! That mysterious machine in the corner that didn't do anything!
674)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} The objects of utmost importance were taken care of. Stowed away in a safe place.
675)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Where?
676)  VOODOOLADY
{Default} You have the knowledge of its whereabouts with you right now.{Mystical} You must know HOW, not WHERE, to look.
677)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Couldn't you just tell me directly?
678)  
Your hut! It's been burned down.
679)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} You said your most valuable voodoo possession locked away in a safe place?
680)  VOODOOLADY
That's right.
681)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} And I have all the information I need to find it.
682)  VOODOOLADY
You have the information, but perhaps not the...
683)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Yeah, yeah, I get it. But not the SMARTS. [Sarcastic] Thanks.
684)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern} I was going to say perspective.{Happy} But that too.
685)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Here boy!
686)  GUYBRUSH
[sympathizing] {Whiney} Ooh, that looks uncomfortable.  {Cocky} But at least he's not snapping at me any more.
687)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What about the dessert?{Suspicious} This is one hungry sponge.
688)  VOODOOLADY
{Happy} Ah, what is YOUR favorite thing about dessert, Guybrush?
689)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Running out before the check arrives?
690)  VOODOOLADY
{Default} No,{Mystical} it is the pleasurable SHOCK of something different.
691)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}Ah.
692)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} So, the Sponge needs a big shock for dessert?
693)  VOODOOLADY
{Happy} Yes.
694)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} It says the Feast for the Senses ends with a bellowing belch.
695)  VOODOOLADY
Do not worry about this.{Happy} If you provide La Esponja the first five courses,{Mystical} the location of the final course will undoubtedly reveal itself.
696)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} My favorite type of responsibility: the one that takes care of itself.
697)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} All right, enough about the Feast for now.
698)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You look uncharacteristically grim.
699)  MORGAN
{stern}Eh, it's been one of those days.
700)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}I know what you mean. {stern}Betraying your childhood hero can really take it out of you.
701)  MORGAN
{questioning}Hey, that was just business.
702)  GUYBRUSH
Your business sucks more than the winds of Flotsam.{default}
703)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What are those scary looking drinks?
704)  MORGAN
{serious}They're a row of Blood Island Volcano Shots...
705)  GUYBRUSH
They look...{suspicious}painful.
706)  MORGAN
{stern}Only the first one.{default}
707)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Yikes.{default}
708)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Not that I'm complaining, but {suspicious}why'd you turn down De Singe's contract to hunt down my wife?
709)  GUYBRUSH
[goin' all Shakespeare-y] {Whiney} Alas, poor Hemlock...{Stern} I knew it, this limb, a leg of infinite toe jam, of most excellent thigh cheese... {Surprised} It hath borne its owner's creaking frame a thousand times, and now how clammy and gross within my grasp it wriggles!
710)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Oh well.  Soup's on!
711)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What the-? {Angry} It's empty!
712)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Hmm, a wet severed leg.  Guess that's one item off my Christmas list.
713)  GUYBRUSH
{confused} Hmm.  The fireflies are attracted to the sugar water on the leg.  Fascinating.{Disgust}  Annnd just a little nauseating.
714)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}I've already got three wet legs in my pants... I'd rather not add another one.
715)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Hey De la Soul!
716)  DESINGE
{Stern} What?
717)  DESINGE
{Confused} Ah, pirate humor.
718)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Hey, De Cringe!
719)  GUYBRUSH
Taste the adventure!
720)  DESINGE
{Worried} Ieeeeee!
721)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Hey, vous!
722)  DESINGE
[slightly weary]{Arrogant} What now?
723)  DESINGE
[relieved]{amazed}Ahhhhh!
724)  DESINGE
{Confused} What in ze world-?  Shoo!
725)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous} I think she's hot-headed enough as it is.
726)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm not sure what my wayward hand would do with a pepper.  {Incredulous} You know, since he doesn't have a tongue 'n' all.
727)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I think you should know that I'm still really angry with you.
728)  MORGAN
{stern}Would it help if I bought you a drink?{default}
729)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}What, so you can poison me?  {stern}I'll pass.{default}
730)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I don't think that chest, even though it belongs to the Voodoo Lady, technically counts as a "Sixth Sense."  Maybe what's inside it will, though.
731)  GUYBRUSH
{angry} There's no WAY I'm giving this to De Singe now that I'm so close to enlarging it and curing Elaine!
732)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} La Esponja Grande won't work on Elaine until I complete the Feast for the Senses!
733)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I notice that you are without "Pox."
734)  MORGAN
{serious}I'm Pox free. Tested on a regular basis.
735)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Do you know why?
736)  MORGAN
{stern}Probably because I'm not really a pirate, since I'm a pirate HUNTER.
737)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Gotta like a Pox that respects minor semantical distinctions.{default}
738)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} That's a good idea, but I better get the lion's paw OUT of its [air quotes] "mouth" first.  I'd hate to lose the Sponge inside its rapacious gullet.
739)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} That's a great idea, but I think I need to find the PART of this plant-beast that's stinking up the jungle.
740)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Y'know, if you have even a scintilla of a guilty conscience, {confused}I could really use your help.
741)  MORGAN
{questioning}Listening.
742)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}There's this trial going on...
743)  MORGAN
So I've heard. Some guy was trying to tell me that it's the [impersonating Stan] "Trial of the century-y-y-y-y."
744)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Yeah, well, I could really some trumped-up evidence.  {incredulous}Or a few intimidated witnesses.  {embarrassed}Or maybe a well-placed bribe or ten.
745)  MORGAN
{stern}You couldn't afford me.
746)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Changed your mind about helping me with my legal troubles?{default}
747)  MORGAN
{serious}The pirate legal system and I don't exactly get along. And if we did, {stern}I wouldn't do pro bono work.{default}
748)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}Oh, what the heck...
749)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Sweet!
750)  ELAINE
{Evil} Arrrgh!  Shiny!
751)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}What did De Singe want with Elaine, anyway?{default}
752)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Jungle fireflies!  Nature's little spotlights!
753)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I'd better not.  The diabetics of Flotsam would never forgive me.
754)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Well, I can see you've got inner demons to wrestle with, {stern}so I'll just get on with my life.{default}
755)  MORGAN
{serious}Thanks.  {terrified}And watch out for De Singe... that thing he did with his finger was...{disgusted} unnatural.{default}
756)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Stan?
757)  STAN
{Smarmy} Guybrush Threepwood!  Nice to see you out and about, kid!  Hope they haven't been treating you too badly in the hoosegow!
758)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Well there IS a pretty scary looking rat in my cell...{Worried} at least I hope it's a rat.
759)  STAN
{Smarmy} That's just swell, kid!{Annoyed}  Look, could you get out of the way and make room for some paying customers?
760)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Stan!
761)  STAN
{Smarmy} That's my name, kid!
762)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Morgan!  {scared}What do you think you're doing!?{default}
763)  MORGAN
{stern}Don't ask me, {strained}ask your crazy wife!
764)  ELAINE
{angry}I'm gonna run you through{evil} ya High Seas Hussy!
765)  STAN
{Thinking} Threepwood!  No hard feelings over all those various civil and criminal charges?
766)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Water under the bridge!
767)  STAN
Great-
768)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} [muttering] A bridge with a fast-talking shyster-slash-salesman dangling from it.
769)  STAN
{Surprised} Ulp!
770)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Stan.
771)  STAN
{Smarmy} Guybrush, ol' pal!
772)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} What are you doing out here?{Confused} Shouldn't you be prepping for trial?
773)  STAN
{Smarmy} Hey, no offense, kid, but the day ol' Stan can't beat you in open court with one wildly flapping arm tied behind his back is the day I haul my corpus juris back to Jambalaya Island for a full restitutio in integrum, know what I mean?
774)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Okay, this is {cocky}really flattering, but {suspicious}let's calm down and talk this out adults.{default}
775)  ELAINE
{evil}I'll be calm when {angry}LeFlay's been filleted like a fish!
776)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Ladies, please {proud}there's plenty of Guybrush Threepwood to go around...{default}
777)  MORGAN
{questioning}Get over yourself, Threepwood!
778)  ELAINE
{evil}Well, there won't be when I'M done with ya!
779)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}You two fight like girls.
780)  MORGAN
{strained}We kill like 'em too.
781)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}Yikes!{default}
782)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Not really.
783)  STAN
Exactly.
784)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} So, if you're not preparing for trial,{Confused} what ARE you doing out here?
785)  STAN
{Smarmy} Following Stan's rule #1 - A.B.M.!
786)  GUYBRUSH
A.B.M.?
787)  STAN
Always Be Merchandising!
788)  STAN
People love following the trials of famous pirates, even B-List pirates like yourself!
789)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} B-List?
790)  STAN
That's why ol' Stan got all the souvenirs and timeless keepsakes you'll ever need to remind you of this month's [here Stan adds his own echo] Trial of the Century-y-y-y!
791)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} How're sales going?
792)  STAN
{Smarmy} Great!  Celebrity merchandise is always a good investment, especially if you suspect that the celebrity in question is about to become a wind chime in the gallows! NOTHING sells like dead celebrities.
793)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Hey Morgan, {suspicious}I think you're losing your edge.
794)  MORGAN
{stern}I'll show you an EDGE.
795)  MORGAN
{terrified}Whoa!{default}
796)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}[sauve]Hey, ladies!{default}
797)  ELAINE
{evil}[Annoyed, in a sword fight] What?!
798)  MORGAN
{stern}[Annoyed, in a sword fight] What?!
799)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Elaine, tuckle-bear! Morgan's all bark and no bite!{default}
800)  MORGAN
{stern}You want bite? You got it. {sarcastic}And I'll throw in the bark for free.
801)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Yeah, well I don't plan on dying today.
802)  STAN
And I didn't plan to wear the same jacket for 20 years, but here we are.
803)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Still trying to make a buck on my recently-cleared name?
804)  STAN
{Smarmy} Naw, I sold all that junk to that D'Oro sap.  I've moved on to the NEXT Trial of the Century - Flotsam Island v. LeChuck and the Voodoo Lady!
805)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Elaine, you should know{incredulous} that Morgan and I spent a few nights together inside of a manatee.
806)  ELAINE
{surprised}Inside of a WHAT?!
807)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}[very nervous] Uh...{default}
808)  ELAINE
{evil}You're a DOG GUYBRUSH THREEPWOOD!
809)  ELAINE
{surprised}Ahh!{default}
810)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Wow, Morgan, you're {happy}pretty handy with a sword.
811)  ELAINE
{evil}IS THAT SO!? What ELSE is she handy with?!
812)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Can't you two just work it out over a nice grog-a-tini?
813)  MORGAN
{sarcastic}THE Guybrush Threepwood is buying me a drink?
814)  ELAINE
{angry}Over your dead body, trollop!
815)  MORGAN
{stern}Who you calling trollop, Schooner-Mom?!{default}
816)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Oh boy.{default}
817)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} How're sales going NOW?
818)  STAN
{Smarmy} Great!  People can't get enough of the Voodoo Lady's murky moral ambiguity, mysterious unexplored backstory, and her ample--
819)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} La-la-la, I'm not listening!
820)  STAN
Voodoo charms!  And as for LeChuck, well, let's just say the lady pirates love, love, LOVE a tale of a redemption, the whole "bad boy made good" angle.
821)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} Argh.
822)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Okay, I'm gonna go think of something clever.  {suspicious}Try not to kill each other while I'm away.{default}
823)  MORGAN
{stern}Yee-ah!{default}
824)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Stan, about these charges...
825)  STAN
{Thinking} Sorry kid, can't talk!  Conflict of interest, attorney-pirate privilege and all that stuff!
826)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} But--
827)  STAN
La-la-la-la, not talking to you about it!
828)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Have the Voodoo Lady and LeChuck been put on trial yet?
829)  STAN
{Smarmy} Have they?  It's the [Stan provides his own echo here] Trial of the Century-y-y-y!
830)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused }Wait, I thought I was the{Happy} [Guybrush provides his own echo] Trial of the Century-y-y-y!
831)  STAN
{Thinking} Yesterday's news, Threepwood!
832)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} So, what kind of case are you building against LeChuck and the Voodoo Lady?
833)  STAN
{Thinking} Oh, I'm not prosecuting them... I'm defending them!
834)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} What?{Confused} Why?
835)  STAN
Why do I do anything, Threepwood?  Money!  Pieces of Eight!  Filthy Lucre!  That Voodoo Lady babe is loa-ded!
836)  STAN
Funny thing, though, she only let me take the case if I'd defend LeChuck, too...
837)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Funny like a peg leg...
838)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Have you seen my wife?
839)  STAN
{Confused} Have I?  That crazy sea-devil hit me up for one of my Patented and Perfectly Passable Porcelain Power Pirate Treasure Maps before hightailing it for the jungle.{Smarmy}  If we're lucky, that thing'll keep her going around in circles for weeks!
840)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} I notice that YOU'RE remarkably free of the Pox.
841)  STAN
{Thinking} Nothing remarkable about it at all, Threepwood!  Haven't you been paying attention?  The Pox only affects real, one hundred percent, honest-to-Blackbeard pirates!
842)  STAN
{Cocky} Now, I've been many things in this life - A salesman, a real estate agent, a troubadour, a stevedore, a ralphadore, and even a brief-but-memorable stint as an exotic dancer to pay my way through law school, but the one thing I'm not, and never will be, is a pirate.
843)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} No matter how many times I see it, I can't get over your jacket.
844)  STAN
{Smarmy} Do you like it?  I just had it in for its annual re-stitching and de-rezzing.
845)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I don't suppose you'd be willing to sell me your eye-bending jacket?
846)  STAN
{Smarmy} Give up my jacket?  That'd be like Samson getting a buzz-cut, or King Arthur losing Excalibur, or Bluebeard dying himself blonde!
847)  GUYBRUSH
Huh?
848)  STAN
Without my jacket, my salesman mojo would wither away faster than a hot house orchid in a pizza oven!
849)  GUYBRUSH
So that's a maybe?
850)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Sure you don't want to sell me your pupil-defying jacket?  It's for a good cause.
851)  STAN
{Happy} This jacket stays with Stan until it literally falls off my back, Threepwood.
852)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} I know I'll kick myself for asking,{Confused} but what sorts of trial souvenirs are you selling?
853)  STAN
{Smarmy} The question you should be asking is, what kind of souvenirs am I NOT selling?  Behold, The People v. Threepwood Collection!
854)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Can I see those Threepwood trial things again?
855)  STAN
{Smarmy} Can't get enough of 'em eh?
856)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What kind of souvenirs could you possibly be making out of the Voodoo Lady and LeChuck?
857)  STAN
{Smarmy} Oh ye of little faith!  Feast your eyes on the all-new People v. LeChuck and the Voodoo Lady Collection!
858)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Can I take another look at your Voodoo Lady 'n' LeChuck gewgaws?
859)  STAN
{Smarmy} Can't keep your eyes off 'em, eh?
860)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I'll see you in court, Stan.
861)  STAN
{Happy} Hey, that's pretty funny!
862)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's that?
863)  STAN
{Smarmy} That, my piratey friend, is a little novelty I like to call, "Draw the Beard on the Guybrush!"  Using the power of magnetism and iron shavings you can give Flotsam's most notorious criminal an infinite array of amusing and degrading hairstyles.  Observe-
864)  STAN
{Surprised} What the-?  This one doesn't have a magnet... {Annoyed} and look, it's leaking iron shavings!
865)  STAN
{Cocky} This is what you get when you use shoddy Phatt Island labor!
866)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey, a little me!
867)  STAN
{Happy} That's right, Threepwood, a faithful reproduction, right down to the lacy garter belt!
868)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Hey, I only wore those once!
869)  GUYBRUSHDOLL
[sounds like Laurence Fishburn, James Earl Jones, the Rock, or some other completely inappropraite actor] It is I, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™.
870)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} That sounds nothing like me!
871)  STAN
{Thinking} Yeah, I know.  To be honest, your real voice didn't focus test all that well.
872)  GUYBRUSHDOLL
[again, with ourcompletely innapropriate actor]  That is the second-largest monkey head I have ever observed!
873)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Aw, it can't even get my catchphrases right.
874)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's this?
875)  STAN
{Thinking} It's a little decorative pin I've whipped up.
876)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} What's that one?
877)  STAN
{Smarmy} That's our "Cursed Cutlass of Kaflu LeChuck" doll.  Press the button for its special "Transforming Glow."
878)  LECHUCKDEMON
[process: doll] What's happening? [use same line as Episode 1]
879)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} It's a little bright.
880)  STAN
Yeah, we're still working out a few kinks.
881)  LECHUCKDEMON
[process: doll] What...What's happening? [use same line as Episode 1]
882)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} What's that?
883)  STAN
{Smarmy} It's my entrancing Voodoo Lady dashboard good luck charm!
884)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Is that supposed to be you?
885)  STAN
{Smarmy} None other! Now you and your friends can relive the Trial of the Century while lounging around in this comfortable poly-blend T-Shirt emblazoned with the iconic image of yours truly, the crusading attorney bringing his no-holds-barred brand of justice to Flotsam Island!
886)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I can't believe you're merchandising yourself.
887)  STAN
{Smarmy} Who better?
888)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} What happened to you?
889)  HARDTACK
{Scared} If you want that banshee on the stand,{Stern} you're gonna hafta serve her yourself!
890)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Nothing like a little hot wax on a cold Flotsam night.
891)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hot, gooey wax...
892)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Now that I've spent some time inside these docile Don Juans of the deep, {worried}I feel kind of queasy about seeing their heads mounted on a wall.
893)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Ah, this must be the "screaming narwhal" that my ship is named after.{disgust}  Creepy.
894)  GUYBRUSH
[whistling while using the facilities]
895)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Whew!  I really needed that.
896)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What's this?
897)  GRINDSTUMP
{happy}That'll be Club 41's famous {proud}Flotsam Island Ladies' Night Buffet Table.  {happy}In a few hours it'll be spilling over with Flaming Chocolate Cupcakes, Barbecued Narwhal Horns, Deep Fried Petit Fours [pronounced "petty fours"], {proud}and all that other girly stuff that our swashbuckling lady pirates love.
898)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[toward Grindstump] Looks like Elaine and Morgan have made {incredulous}a dog's breakfast of your buffet.
899)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}What, that mess?  Pshaw, m'boy, {proud}that's just the typical aftermath of our weekly Ladies' Night Buffet Table.  Our lady pirates may be easy on the eyes, {serious}but heaven help you if you get between them and our bottomless salad bowl.
900)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Yikes.
901)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}There's nothing left of this buffet but a few scraps of tofanatee paste{suspicious} and lite ranch dressing.
902)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}[towards Grindstump] Nice dartboard.
903)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}Isn't it though?  Ah, it was one of the few things I managed to salvage when I was washed ashore on Flotsam all those years ago.
904)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Can I play a round?
905)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}Unfortunately, the darts were lost a few weeks ago during a bar fight.  {disappointed}Pity, too, {confused}what with the annual Flotsam Island Dart Tournament tomorrow night.
906)  ROCKRIB
[voice only] How about a towel, sir?
907)  GUYBRUSH
Thanks.
908)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I don't need to use the facilities right now.  Besides, {suspicious}that towel guy was a little creepy.
909)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Yipes!
910)  ELAINE
{evil}Get out of the way, ya blithering hunk of man-meat!
911)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I won't be able to get any closer to the dartboard with those {confused}hell-kittens in the way.
912)  GRINDSTUMP
Fore!
913)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}Would you mind steering clear of the dartboard?  Now that I've found me darts, {proud}I need to practice before tomorrow night's tournament.
914)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}The Judge mixes a mean drink, {suspicious}but he's a horrible shot.
915)  GRINDSTUMP
[Angry] Captain Threepwood, having been found guilty of all charges, you will be taken to the nearest ship and keelhauled until yer ravaged skin hangs in tatters from your bleeding--
916)  GUYBRUSH
[interrupting][panicky] Guilty!?  But I haven't been charged with anything yet!
917)  GRINDSTUMP
You haven't!?  Where's that incompetent prosecutor?
918)  STAN
[off-screen] Right here, your honor!
919)  GUYBRUSH
[sarcastic] Oh, great…
920)  STAN
Sorry I'm late, your eminence, but ol' Stan had to in flagrante his delicto, and there was a line in the washroom.
921)  GRINDSTUMP
Belay your excuses, ya sniveling sea-weasel, and get on with the charges!  I've got grog waiting for me in Club 41!
922)  STAN
Of course, your immensity!
923)  STAN
Your honor, pirates and wenches of the gallery…
924)  GALLERY1
That's us!
925)  STAN
This evening I will prove, beyond a scintilla of a shadow of a doubt, that Guybrush Threepwood is guilty of no fewer than four heinous crimes!
926)  GALLERY2
Funny, I thought there'd be three…
927)  STAN
Firstly, that he did knowingly engage in a bar fight that horribly injured the beloved feline of local pirate elder, Hemlock McGee!
928)  MCGEE
[voice from gallery] Hanging's too good for 'im!
929)  STAN
Secondly, during this selfsame fight, Captain Threepwood spilled boiling nacho sauce on the exposed leg of Bosun Kathryn Krebbs, hideously scarring one of Flotsam's "Shapeliest Gams"!
930)  KREBBS
[voice from gallery] Skin 'im alive!
931)  STAN
Thirdly, that he did conspire with one Joaquin D'Oro to craft and sell counterfeit Porcelain Power Pirates!
932)  GALLERY1
Whatta jerk!
933)  STAN
And finally, that he folded, spindled and mutilated this previously pristine X belonging to Flotsam's newest arrival, Killick Hardtack!
934)  GUYBRUSH
[turning towards Hardtack] What the heck?
935)  HARDTACK
[looking somewhat guilty] Um, yeah.  He did that to me!
936)  GRINDSTUMP
Captain Threepwood, having heard the grave charges arrayed against you, how do you plead?
937)  HARDTACK
The Pirate Court of Flotsam Island is back in session, the Right Honorable Wallace P. Grindstump presiding.
938)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Let's keep it moving, Captain Threepwood.
939)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Time is grog, Captain.
940)  HARDTACK
The Pirate Court of Flotsam Island is--
941)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Yes, yes.  Get on with it--
942)  GUYBRUSH
{stern} I plead one thousand percent not guilty.  {Confused} Especially to that last one about the X.
943)  GRINDSTUMP
{Happy} Very well.  {Default} Let it be recorded that the {Stern} miserably guilty defendant has entered a plea of not guilty.  {Thinking} Now, {Questioning} who would you like to represent your pathetic case?
944)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} If I plead guilty, will {Confused}I get out of here any quicker?
945)  GRINDSTUMP
{Happy}Most definitely-
946)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Great!  Then I plead-
947)  GRINDSTUMP
{Happy}After the summary executions by keelhauling, hanging, {Thinking}boiling, and [as though looking on a lost] scaphism.
948)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Scaphism?
949)  STAN
{Cocky} Trust me, kid, you don't want to know.
950)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious}Okay, then…
951)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I plead not guilty {Incredulous} by reason of insanity!
952)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning}Ye look pretty sane to me…
953)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} Sure, NOW, but any second I could start {Cocky} using monkeys as needle-nose pliers, {Incredulous} or shooting myself out of trebuchets, {Cocky} or doing strange things with rubber trees!  {Incredulous} I'm crazy, I tells ya, {Surprised} craaaaaaazy!
954)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern}The defendant will cease his inane histrionics, or the court will be forced {Evil} to [he goes poxy]YANK OUT HIS TONGUE WITH A RUSTY SHRIMP FORK!  ARRR! [he goes back to normal]
955)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Okay, {Worried} no insanity defense…
956)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} These charges are stupid.  {Cocky} And believe me, I know from stupid!
957)  GRINDSTUMP
{Angry} Captain Threepwood, you're out of order!
958)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm out of order!?  {Angry} You're out of order!  {Stern} The whole mizzen-masted pirate legal system is out of order!
959)  GRINDSTUMP
[he goes poxy]  {Evil} THE DEFENDANT WILL SHUT HIS FESTERING GOB BEFORE THE COURT SHUTS IT FOR HIM!
960)  MCGEE
Do it!
961)  GUYBRUSH
[meek] {Worried} Sorry…
962)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Don't you have some sort of public defender?
963)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} A public defender!?  In pirate court?  {Happy} Bwah-hah-hah-hah!
964)  MCGEE
Whatta maroon!
965)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} So, that'd be a "no" then.
966)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Hey Stan, why don't you represent me, {Cocky} for old times' sake?
967)  STAN
{Default} You mean those old times when you {Annoyed} swindled me out of a ship, stuck me in a coffin for three months, scammed my insurance company, and got me {Confused} involved with high risk doubloon derivatives?
968)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} Um, yes?
969)  STAN
{Default} Sorry, kid.  Nothing personal, but I {Smarmy}stand to make a bundle in legal fees off these honked-off Flotsamites.  {Cocky}They really don't like you!
970)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I guess I'll represent myself.
971)  GRINDSTUMP
{Default} Captain Threepwood, are you aware of the old pirate court saying, {Stern} "the pirate who represents himself in court {Sarcastic} has a soon-to-be-keelhauled fool for a client?"
972)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Yes, your honor…{Proud} and I am that fool!
973)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Fine.  {Default}Your move, counselor!
974)  STAN
{Cocky} Here's your briefs, kid.
975)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} I, um, {Confused} don't know what to do.
976)  GRINDSTUMP
[poxy]{Evil} THAT'S WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE A LAWYER, YA BLITHERING BLATHERSKITE!
977)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Sorry.
978)  STAN
{Default} Look, Threepwood, it's pretty easy.  You can call witnesses for any of the cases.  Once they're on the stand, you can question them, confront them with evidence from the evidence table {Cocky}  (if it's pertinent to the case), {Default} or attempt to confront them with new evidence that you've brought into court.
979)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern}Ye'd best be careful about that last one, though.  Nothing gets on me nerves more than a defendant attempting to clog my court with {Angry} useless chunks of jetsam!
980)  STAN
{Default} And, of course, you can always ask for a recess, {Cocky} so you can check your briefs.
981)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Thanks.
982)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Your honor, I'd like to call a recess to {Suspicious} confer with my client.
983)  GRINDSTUMP
{default} Bailiff, please escort Captain Threepwood to the brig!
984)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Your honor, I'd like to approach the bench.
985)  GRINDSTUMP
{Angry} Denied!  {Stern} No one approaches my bench!
986)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I object!
987)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} To what?
988)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} To this trial!  {Stern} To your hat!  {Whiny}To the way my beard's itching!  {Sarcastic} I also object to the way that guy's looking at me!  {Incredulous} And to this hook! And-
989)  GALLERY1
Hey!
990)  GRINDSTUMP
[full pox] {Evil} CAPTAIN THREEPWOOD, YOU WILL CEASE YOUR FOOLISH DISTRACTIONS BEFORE WE COME DOWN AND CEASE THEM FOR YOU! ARRRRR!!!
991)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}Your honor, I'd like to request a change of venue!
992)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning} Where to?
993)  GUYBRUSH
[flirting]  {Cocky} Oh, how about back at your place… {Incredulous} just you, me, a jug of grog, a loaf of bread, and some {Happy} scandalous legal briefs…
994)  GRINDSTUMP
[full pox] {Evil} CAPTAIN THREEPWOOD WILL TERMINATE HIS CLUMSY AND OFF-PUTTING ATTEMPTS TO SEDUCE THIS COURT AT ONCE! ARRRR!!!!
995)  GALLERY1
Darned skippy!
996)  GALLERY2
Made me uncomfortable, it did!
997)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}Your honor, I'd like to invoke my {Proud} ex post facto privileges and move for a dramatis personae.
998)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} No?  Then can I {Cocky} exeunt omnes my quid pro quo?
999)  GRINDSTUMP
{Angry}Captain Threepwood…
1000)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} Well, surely the court will give me time until my {Confused} e pluribus unum reductios ad absurdum?
1001)  GRINDSTUMP
[full pox] {Evil} THE DEFENDANT WILL STOP PRETENDING THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO SPEAK LATIN!
1002)  GRINDSTUMP
{Angry} Hmph.
1003)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} I'd like to call Joaquin Jocinto {Confused} De Meara Alphonso D'Oro {Default} to the stand.
1004)  HARDTACK
Joaquin D'Oro!
1005)  HARDTACK
{Default} Do you swear on Blackbeard's log to tell the truth to the best of your ability as a grog-swilling, back-stabbing pirate?
1006)  DORO
{Default} Si.
1007)  STAN
{Thinking} Señor D'Oro…
1008)  DORO
[correcting] Captain D'Oro.
1009)  STAN
{Cocky} Yes, of course.  {Confused} Why are you here today?
1010)  DORO
{Worried} I was recently arrested for trying to sell a counterfeit Dark Ninja Dave Porcelain Power Pirate figurine… {Stern} a counterfeit figurine crafted by Guybrush Threepwood!
1011)  GALLERY2
Actually, that wasn't so surprising…
1012)  STAN
{Cocky} Your witness, counselor.
1013)  GUYBRUSH
I'd like to recall Captain D'Oro to the stand.
1014)  HARDTACK
Someone pull D'Oro out of his cell!
1015)  GRINDSTUMP
{Default} The court would like to remind {Sarcastic} "Captain D'Oro" {Default} that he's still under oath.
1016)  GUYBRUSH
I'd like to call Bosun Kathryn Krebbs to the stand.
1017)  HARDTACK
Kathryn Krebbs!
1018)  KREBBS
{Sarcastic} Aye!
1019)  STAN
{Default} Bosun Krebbs, could you tell the court what {Confused} happened on that fateful day.
1020)  KREBBS
{Serious} Aye… I was mindin' my own business at Club 41 with a mug full of grog and some {Sarcastic} zesty nachos, when all of a sudden {Annoyed} THAT blindfolded jasper barreled into me, knocked me nacho sauce into me lap, {Sad} and gave me THIS disfiguring scar!
1021)  GALLERY2
Hotchy-motchy!
1022)  MCGEE
Aye, that takes me back…
1023)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Ew.
1024)  GRINDSTUMP
{Default} Bailiff, supply the prosecutor and the defendant with sketches of the burns for their briefs.
1025)  HARDTACK
{Sarcastic} Aye-aye, your honor!
1026)  STAN
{Cocky} Lotsa luck, kid.
1027)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I'd like to recall Bosun Krebbs to the stand.
1028)  GRINDSTUMP
{Happy} Now remember, darlin', yer still under oath.
1029)  KREBBS
{Serious} Aye.
1030)  GUYBRUSH
I'd like to call Hemlock McGee to the stand.
1031)  HARDTACK
Hemlock McGee!
1032)  MCGEE
{Confused} What's that? {Default} Oh…
1033)  HARDTACK
And do you swear on Blackbeard's -
1034)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} Yeah, yeah, yeah.  {Stern} Listen, pinky, {Sarcastic} I knew Blackbeard back when he was "Blotchy Black Peach Fuzz."  {Stern} Just let me at 'im. Let me at 'im!
1035)  STAN
{Thinking} Ensign McGee, it's your contention that Captain Threepwood injured your cat.
1036)  MCGEE
{Confused} Injured?  {Stern} He practically crushed him!  {Angry} Hit him right in the puss with a stuffed manatee head, he did!
1037)  STAN
And how is your cat today?
1038)  MCGEE
{Sad} See for yourself!  {Worried}The poor dear's paralyzed with fear!  I have to feed her through a tube!  {Sad} Oh, my poor Miss Prettywhiskers!  [Hemlock begins sobbing]
1039)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Prettywhiskers?  <snort>
1040)  STAN
{Cocky} Your witness, kid.
1041)  GUYBRUSH
I'd like to call Hemlock McGee back to the stand.
1042)  HARDTACK
Hem-!
1043)  MCGEE
{Angry} I'm right here!
1044)  GRINDSTUMP
I'd like to remind--
1045)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} Yeah, yeah, I'm still under oath.
1046)  GUYBRUSH
If it pleases the court, I'd like to call Bailiff Hardtack to the stand!
1047)  HARDTACK
{Default} Bailiff Hardtack!  {Happy} Oh, that's me!
1048)  HARDTACK
{Suspicious} I suppose.

{Stern} The witness is reminded that he is still under oath.
1067)  
Actually, I'd rather not call a witness right now.
1068)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} You're lying about this whole nacho business aren't you?
1069)  KREBBS
{Serious} Nay.  {Sarcastic} Are you lying about being a Mighty Pirate™?

{Default} Bosun Krebbs.  {Cocky} You don't really expect this court to believe that the nacho sauce I allegedly spilled onto your leg from this platter actually scarred your leg, do you?
1121)  KREBBS
{Sad} Arr, but it did!  {Sarcastic} See for yourself!
1122)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Are you SURE this is the nacho platter that torched your shapely thigh?

{Sarcastic} Sure as me name is Kathryn Krebbs!

{Annoyed} Objection, your honor!  Defense is stalling for time.
1125)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern}Move it along, counselor.
1126)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Your honor, I'd like to enter this leg-shaped lamp into evidence that Bosun Krebbs was not, in fact, {Incredulous} scalded by Club 41's Nacho Sauce.
1127)  KREBBS
{Confused} What, with that burn?  {Sarcastic} It's not even the same color as my burn, see?
1128)  GRINDSTUMP
{Default} I'm not allowing that leg lamp into evidence until it's got a burn that at least matches the {Stern}  COLOR of the plaintiff's scar.
1129)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'd better not.  It's still not the same color as Kathryn's burns.
1130)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Your honor, I'd like to {Cocky} introduce this leg lamp into evidence as proof that Bosun Kathryn Krebbs's is {Stern}  lying about her so-called nacho sauce burn!
1131)  KREBBS
{Annoyed} This proves nothing!
1132)  STAN
{Annoyed} Objection, your honor!  The scars on this leg-shaped lamp may look like my client's, but who knows how they got there?
1133)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I'm glad you asked…
1134)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} So, you see, your honor, Kathryn's distinctive burns were not caused by Club 41's nacho sauce, but {Cocky} by an unlikely combination of scalding fluids found throughout Flotsam Island!  {Stern} Isn't that true, Bosun Krebbs?
1135)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Answer the question, ya she-devil!
1136)  KREBBS
{Serious} It-it's true!  After Guybrush knocked that platter of nachos onto my lap, I saw my chance for revenge, {Sad} and concocted this foolish scheme!
1137)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Revenge?
1138)  KREBBS
{Confused} You still don't remember me?  {Serious} The woman whose ship you sunk?  {Sad} Who spent years languishing in prison for your crimes?  {Annoyed} The woman whose husband you humiliated in that {Sad} creepy karaoke contest?

1145)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Knock it off, you lot!
1146)  GUYBRUSH
Your honor, I'd like to introduce this caustic agent into evidence as an alternative cause of Bosun Kathryn's burn.
1147)  KREBBS
Oh yeah? Prove it!
1148)  STAN
Objection!  Defense is trying to cloud the issue!
1149)  GRINDSTUMP
Sustained!  Captain Threepwood, if you have an alternative theory as to the cause of the Bosun's horrific injury, do the Court the courtesy of fleshing it out before introducing random cups of bubbling goo into evidence!
1150)  GUYBRUSH

I thought for sure that would do something.
1157)  GUYBRUSH
I better not go whipping out my monkey in the middle of court again until I'm sure his animal magnetism will do something useful.
1158)  GUYBRUSH
Your honor, pirates and assorted buccaneers. {Suspicious}  Hemlock McGee has asserted that it was {Proud} I, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™, that brought about the horrible emotional scars that even now leave {Worried} poor Miss Prettywhiskers paralyzed with fear. {Cocky} But I put it to you that it was not your humble defendant who traumatized Hemlock's unfortunate feline, but a far more {Incredulous} insidious assailant, one who's in this very courtroom as I speak. {Stern}  J'accuse…
1159)  MCGEE
{Confused} What?

1169)  GRINDSTUMP
{Stern} Don't MAKE me send the bailiff up there!
1170)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} So, it's your contention that I scared your cat so badly {Cocky} that's it's paralyzed with fear?
1171)  MCGEE
{Sad}Aye, it hasn't moved a muscle {stern} since you sat on it {Sad} back in Club 41!

{Angry} Captain Threepwood.  {Stern} Quit tormenting Ensign McGee's cat and get on with your case… {Sarcastic} assuming you have one.
1178)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} So you claim that I, {Proud} Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™, {Cocky} created this stunningly realistic counterfeit Porcelain Power Pirate figure.
1179)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} How can you be so sure?
1180)  DORO
{Default} Because it was made from one of {Suspicious} my extra Pink Pajamas Pierre Porcelain Power Pirate figures… {Stern} one that disappeared right after you visited me!  {Sarcastic} See, it's got my name stamped right there on the bottom of its foot!
1181)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} Well, what do you know…
1182)  DORO
{Default} Also, that {Suspicious} so-called Killer Karate Katana is actually a {Sarcastic} cheap porcelain grogatini sword from Club 41… and I know for a fact {Cocky} that you were the only person to order a {Stern} grogatini that day!
1183)  GUYBRUSH

{default}Well sure, but [interrupting himself] {angry} Hold on, did you just call me Skinny?  I've seen skeletons fatter than you!
1304)  CRIMPDIGIT
{cocky}It's not MY fault you associate with the obese undead.
1305)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} So, what have you been up to while I've been out trying to save your shapely bacon?
1306)  ELAINE
[angry]{Evil} I've been out swashbuckling and looking for buried treasure, like a REAL pirate!
1307)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Okay, I know that's the Pox talking, but still… {Worried}ouch.
1308)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Don't worry, angel,{Confused} um, face. {Incredulous} Everything'll be okay once I toss La Esponja Grande into that noisy ancient doohickey!
1309)  ELAINE
[angry]{Evil} Then stop yakking and get on with it, ya gibbering jellyfish!
1310)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} De Singe killed Morgan!
1311)  ELAINE
{Evil}He did?  Well, maybe the cheese-eating beaker monkey ain't so bad after all!  Arrr!
1312)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Did you hear?  The Voodoo Lady's been playing us for chumps all these years!
1313)  ELAINE
[poxed and angry] {Evil} Arrr!  I never did trust that scheming sea-witch!
1314)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised}Once I get you cured, we should go break LeChuck out of jail!
1315)  ELAINE
[annoyed]{Evil} THAT spineless goody-two-boots?  Let him rot!
1316)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky}Chill out, I've got this.
1317)  ELAINE
{Evil} Arrrr.
1318)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Hey Elaine!
1319)  ELAINE
[angry and continuing to wave her sword at De Singe]{Evil} What!?
1320)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} My hand is De Singe's only source of Jus de Vie! {Default} If you cut it off his turban, he'll be a lot easier to kill!
1321)  ELAINE
[angry and continuing to wave her sword at De Singe] {Evil} What do you THINK I've been trying to do, ya barmy halfwit!?
1322)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern}While you're flailing away at De Singe, do you think you could knock that sponge out of my severed hand?
1323)  ELAINE
[angry and continuing to wave her sword at De Singe]{Evil} The only place this sword is going is through this snuff-sniffer's gizzard!  Arrr!
1324)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Hang in there, sweetie!
1325)  ELAINE
[angry and continuing to wave her sword at De Singe]{Evil} Less talking, more eviscerating, [sarcastic] "sweetie."
1326)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Hey, De Winge!
1327)  DESINGE
{Angry} That's De Singe!
1328)  GUYBRUSH
Whatever.
1329)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What are you doing to the Wind Control Device?  It sounds like it's about to explode!
1330)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} I'm so glad you asked.  You see, using my hand-built Harpsichronitron, in conjunction with my Oscimoligorphiscope to seek out a resonant frequency in the Vaycaylian Climatiphone , I hope to anatomize living tissue on a macroscopic basis!
1331)  GUYBRUSH
{confused} Could you run through the purposes of all this machinery again?
1332)  DESINGE
{Angry} Sigh. [explaining as though to a three year old] I'm going to use this machine to make that machine smash people into a fine powder.
1333)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Oh. [realizing]{Angry} Hey, that's not very nice!
1334)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} All right, De Strange, you've got me where you want me, now let my wife go!
1335)  DESINGE
{Sarcastic} You?  I don't want YOU and your pathetically Pox-free body anymore.  {Angry} YOUR WIFE, on the other hand, is teeming with the special "Threepwood Strain" of the Pox I need to create more of my Jus de Vie!
1336)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Let me get this straight… you DON'T want me anymore?
1337)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} Not in the slightest.  It's your WIFE'S juicy strain of the Pox that fuels my scientific longings now!
1338)  ELAINE
{Evil} I've got yer juicy strain right here, bucko!
1339)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's my hand doing up there on that turban?
1340)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} Your hand is nobly sacrificing the last dribs and drabs of its wondrous Pox to supply me with enough death-defying Jus de Vie to keep me intact until I spread your wife's Pox across the seas!
1341)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Poor little fella looks horrible.
1342)  DESINGE
{Sarcastic} Sadly, yes.  I suspect he will not survive.  {Happy} Ah well. C'est le Jus de Vie.
1343)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} So, why a turban?  Shouldn't you have a beret or some other French chapeau?
1344)  DESINGE
{Confused} French?  [insulted, and pushing his accent to the limit] {Angry} Whatever gave you zee ridiculous idea that I'm French?
1345)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} But, um, I just kinda assumed…
1346)  DESINGE
{Angry} Why, ze nerve of some people…hmph!
1347)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} You'll PAY for what you did to Morgan, you fiend!
1348)  DESINGE
{Sarcastic} I already DID pay for her services. {Arrogant} A big sack of silver, as I recall…
1349)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Not for that!  For killing her!
1350)  DESINGE
Hmmph.  Pirates and pirate hunters! Your kind always seem to meet an early demise. {Angry}  Good riddance!
1351)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} I STILL think you murdered Morgan!
1352)  DESINGE
{sarcastic} Ooh, the Mighty Pirate™ thinks I murdered his friend!  However will I live with the shame?
1353)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} Hey, De Monkey!
1354)  DESINGE
[trying to avoid Elaine's sword, not really looking at Guybrush]{Angry} What!?
1355)  GUYBRUSH
{angry} Hey, De Sing-Song!
1356)  DESINGE
[trying to avoid Elaine's sword, not really looking at Guybrush]{Angry} What!?
1357)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} You'll never get past my wife's sword, ya know.  I once saw her hold off a horde of angry Rotarians with nothing more than a pen knife and a feather duster!
1358)  DESINGE
[still trying to avoid the sword]{Arrogant} Impressive, but unless they were invulnerable Rotarians fueled by my incredible Jus de Vie, there's really no comparison.
1359)  DESINGE
{stern} Soon she will tire, and her Pox will be mine to spread across the four corners of the Earth!
1360)  ELAINE
{Evil}I'll spread you to the four corners!!
1361)  DESINGE
{Worried} Oowww!
1362)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I really don't think you have a chance against my wife.
1363)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} Please.  She's nothing more than a mere pirate wench, while I am an invulnerable man of SCIENCE!
1364)  ELAINE
[angry]{Evil} Arrrrr!
1365)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} You look like you've got your hands, er, hand full.  Why don't you let me hold onto that Sponge for a minute.
1366)  DESINGE
{Angry}What sort of idiot do you take me for, Threepwood?
1367)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Is that a trick question?
1368)  GUYBRUSH
[intentionally trying to honk off elaine] {Cocky} Once you're done pulverizing my wife, any chance I could get my hands on some of that Jus de Vie?
1369)  ELAINE
[angry]{Evil}  Arrr!
1370)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Nothing personal honey, it's just that you look kinda done for, and invulnerability could come in really handy in my line of work.
1371)  ELAINE
[angry] I'll show you who's done for!
1372)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Don't go anywhere.  I'd hate for you to miss my heroic moment of triumph.
1373)  DESINGE
[still fighting Elaine]{Arrogant} I'm counting the moments.
1374)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} [in pain] Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
1375)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Okay, mental note -{Incredulous} the Fugu Jolokia is hot to the touch, too.
1376)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} [in pain, but screaming like his tongue is hanging out] Aawawawawawawawawawawawa!
1377)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Ouch.
1378)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Apparently not.
1379)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} I should really stop doing that until I find a way to protect my tongue.
1380)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} I've probably got permanent glossal damage, {Cocky} but it was totally worth it to get my hook on that pepper.
1381)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Hey, where's my dinner? {Happy} My haute cuisine?
1382)  HARDTACK
{Sarcastic} Oh, the prisoners don't get any food, {Cocky} that's for the guards and the judges. {Happy} Delicious, too.
1383)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Jerk.
1384)  HARDTACK
{Cocky} Heh.
1385)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Hmph.  Nothin.
1386)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Hmph.  Nothin'. {Incredulous} Guess De Singe wasn't kidding about the fireflies sticking to the jungle.
1387)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Ahhh, I don't think I've got enough sugar to sweeten the entire ocean.
1388)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} I wonder if Club 41's changed its restrictive policies…
1389)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I guess so…
1390)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "Stan's Courtroom Souvenir Emporium?" {Confused} What happened to the Keelhauler-Gazette Offices?
1391)  STAN
{Happy} The Keelhauler?  That's old news, Threepwood!  Get it?  Old news?  The whole Keelhauler operation was bought out and shut down by those bigwigs at the Flotsam Times weeks ago!
1392)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Ooh, I bet Davey Nipperkin didn't like that.
1393)  STAN
Are you kidding?  Ol' Nipperkin made out like a bandit!  I heard he's getting ready to retire on his share of the sale!
1394)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Just when my opinion of the legal profession couldn't get any lower, along comes Stan…
1395)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]"Hear ye, hear ye.  Having finally captured the vile criminal GUYBRUSH THREEPWOOD, the Right Honorable Judge Wallace P. Grindstump has been recalled from his summer vacation to adjudicate and pass sentence on the loathsome reprobate.  A public execution has been scheduled for dawn in the town square.  Sandwiches will be provided. BYOG."
1396)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} At least there'll be sandwiches.
1397)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]"Hear ye, hear ye.  Now that the vile, but nevertheless innocent GUYBRUSH THREEPWOOD has been cleared of all charges, the trials of the seemingly-noble LECHUCK and the mysterious VOODOO LADY will commence posthaste.  Those wishing to bring additional charges against these villains are encouraged to file a claim with the court before the cock crows."
1398)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Hey, I've got a complaint or ten…
1399)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Darn.
1400)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Nice to see they updated their motto.
1401)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]"Ladies' Night - Club 41 Open to the Public!"
1402)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} That's a welcome change of pace.
1403)  GUYBRUSH
That lamp is leaking oil.
1404)  HARDTACK
Not just any oil…{Happy} manatee oil!
1405)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust}Aw, that's not right.
1406)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I can't pick up hot manatee oil with my bare hands.
1407)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I almost feel guilty about this. {Cocky} Almost.
1408)  GUYBRUSH
I've already got enough manatee oil to suit my needs for now.
1409)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Hey, guard!
1410)  HARDTACK
{Confused} What do you want?
1411)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Aren't I entitled to some bread and water?
1412)  HARDTACK
{Sarcastic} Bread and water, pfah! {Happy} I pride meself on providing Flotsam's prisons with the finest in haute cuisine!  Wait here!
1413)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} "Wait here"… that's funny.
1414)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's a guy gotta do to get a drink around here?
1415)  HARDTACK
There's a bar right over there. {Sarcastic} All you gotta do is get released, and you can walk right in.
1416)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Has this jail got any reading material?
1417)  HARDTACK
I'd suggest reading your legal briefs. {Sarcastic} You might need 'em.
1418)  GUYBRUSH
Good tip. {Incredulous} I'll get right on that when I need something to put me to sleep.
1419)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I wanna see my lawyer!
1420)  HARDTACK
{Confused} Your lawyer?
1421)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Yeah, you might have heard of him… {Proud}Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™-At-Law?
1422)  HARDTACK
{Default} Fine.
1423)  HARDTACK
All right, counselor, Judge Grindstump says you got five minutes…
1424)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} That should be more than enough for this piece of scumm.
1425)  HARDTACK
{Confused} Again?
1426)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} He's not getting any smarter.
1427)  GUYBRUSH
Nothin'.
1428)  HARDTACK
{Cocky} Well, you'll get plenty of that in there.
1429)  HARDTACK
{Stern} Hmph.
1430)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I hope you had a good excuse for dragging me out of bed at this ungodly hour.
1431)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I need to know how my case is going.{Worried} I haven't heard from you in days!
1432)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Not to worry, old bean. I think I can talk the judge down from draw-and-quartering to draw-and-thirding!
1433)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} You fraud!
1434)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I've got a plan to break out of this joint, but I need your help to smuggle in a wombat and two sticks of string cheese!
1435)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} You want me, an officer of the court, to aid in a jail break? {Incredulous} Why the mere idea is so preposterous that it's practically postposterous!
1436)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Why you-
1437)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} I'm worried about my wife, counselor. {Whiney} She hasn't sent me a letter in weeks.
1438)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I wouldn't worry about her, Guybrush. {Cocky} We're taking very good care of her on my estate. {Proud} VERY good care.
1439)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} You scurvy backstabber!  I'll-
1440)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Guard! {Confused} I'm quite done with my client!
1441)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} I'll get you Threepwood, if it's the last thing I do!
1442)  HARDTACK
{Concerned} Sorry about that, Mr. Threepwood.  I know those prisoners can be a rowdy lot.
1443)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Think nothing of it, Mister Hardtack. {Happy} Now, where can I find a good grog?
1444)  HARDTACK
{Happy} Club 41's right over there, sir.
1445)  HARDTACK
{suspicious}Who goes there?
1446)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}It's me, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™-At-Law!
1447)  HARDTACK
{enthused}Ah, counselor Threepwood.  What can I do for you?
1448)  HARDTACK
{surprised}Who goe-?  Oh, it's you.
1449)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I'd like to return to court to defend my client!
1450)  HARDTACK
{Happy} All righty then!  Let's find Judge Grindstump…
1451)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Can I go back in? {Whiney} I think I left several useful items in there.
1452)  HARDTACK
Court is adjourned until the new defendants prepare their cases.
1453)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}What are you doing on Flotsam Island, anyway?
1454)  HARDTACK
{sad}Well, after that series of misadventures on Spinner Cay, I found meself without a captain or a ship...
1455)  HARDTACK
{sad}Eh, it happens.  So I drifted for a bit before landing here on Flotsam. {happy} Now I've hired on as Judge Grindstump's personal bailiff-slash-chef, creating all sorts of new delicacies for his nightclub.  It's a bit of a dream come true, it is.
1456)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}How's the Pox of LeChuck treating you?
1457)  HARDTACK
{default}Aw, it's not so bad.  I mean, there is the incessant drive to commit acts of monstrous evil, of course, it's a bit of drag on the social life.  {happy}But my pillaging swing has never been better!  So I guess you could say it's a bit of a wash.
1458)  HARDTACK
{concerned}Tell you one thing I didn't expect - the slaw cravings.   I mean honestly, mate, what's that all about?
1459)  GUYBRUSH
{angry}So, why are you lying about me in court like that?  You and I both know that I never dug up your X.
1460)  HARDTACK
{confused}I know what you're trying to do… you're trying to trick ol' Hardtack up with one of them newfangled recordin' devices!  Well, I ain't sayin' nothin' about my case exceptin' in a pirate court of pirate law!
1461)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Fine.
1462)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} No hard feelings about being humiliated in open court?
1463)  HARDTACK
{Concerned} No worries, mate. {Sarcastic} I've been humiliated so often it's kind of second nature to me by now.
1464)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Great.
1465)  HARDTACK
{Confused} Besides, I didn't really think it was much of a case, anyway. But that Stan fellah seemed to think I could make a pretty piece of eight off your untimely execution, so I figured,{Happy} what the heck?
1466)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I'd like to go into the jungle.  I need to talk to a large Voodoo Lady about a not-so-large sponge.
1467)  HARDTACK
{concerned}Sorry, mate, I'm afraid I can't allow prisoners to wander out into the jungle.  You might get lost or go into hiding.
1468)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}But I'm not a prisoner, I'm the prisoner's attorney, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™-At-Law!
1469)  HARDTACK
[puzzling it out]{confused} Hmmmmm.
1470)  HARDTACK
{suspicious}Well, that is a stumper all right, but just to be on the safe side, I think it would be for the best if I kept BOTH Guybrush Threepwoods out of the jungle until their trials are over.
1471)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Sure I can't go into the jungle?  I'll be back in just a few hours…
1472)  HARDTACK
{angry}I said no!
1473)  GUYBRUSH
{whiny}C'mon, let me in the jungle.
1474)  HARDTACK
[pox-out] {angry}THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GETTING' IN THIS JUNGLE IS IN A PINE BOX, YA SIMPERING SEA WORM!
1475)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Judge Grindstump?
1476)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}Please, no need to be so formal.   {happy}In here I'm just plain ol' W.P. Grindstump, owner and proprietor of Club 41!
1477)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So you're really the owner of Club 41?
1478)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}Have been ever since I won it from the original owner in a dart tournament a few years back.  {questioning}Poor ol' guy never knew what hit him…
1479)  GUYBRUSH
And by "hit him"{suspicious} you mean…
1480)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}A dart, {questioning}right in the ol' noggin.
1481)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I've been wondering, why's this place called "Club 41," anyway?
1482)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}You know, I don't rightly know.  {questioning}The last owner never got a chance to tell me before he succumbed to his {proud}dart-related injuries.
1483)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Aren't you a little upset that {cocky}I'm running around free?
1484)  GRINDSTUMP
{happy}Heavens no!  {confused}What kind of a pirate town would this be if we didn't condone the occasional jail break?
1485)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}What a remarkably progressive attitude.
1486)  GRINDSTUMP
Besides, it's not as though you can really escape the swinging sword of Flotsam justice, {disappointed}what with these blasted winds blowing in again.
1487)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I told you I was innocent!
1488)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}Well bully for you!  {confused}Meanwhile, we're still all Poxed, {disappointed}there's a creepy voodoo priestess in my jail, {confused}and your wife's still threatening to sack our town!  {questioning}Truly, these are the best of times!
1489)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Barkeep, I'd like to order a drink!
1490)  GRINDSTUMP
{happy}Brilliant!  {confused}Will you be paying in doubloons, triploons, coupons, or Flotsamian Ferschafs?
1491)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Actually, I'm a little light right now.
1492)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}No problem, I'll start up a tab!
1493)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You will?  That's so unlike, {suspicious}well, every place I've ever been in my life.
1494)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}Well, it's not like you're going to skip town on me, {happy}am I right?  Har-har-harrr!
1495)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Heh.
1496)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Would you mind knocking it off with the darts for a minute?
1497)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}Not on your life!  I need to get in a week's worth of practice before tomorrow night's tournament, and {questioning}who knows how long those hellions will stay out of my way?
1498)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}"Ladies' Night" is looking a {confused}little, um, grim.
1499)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}Well, it's early.  Once we've got the buffet table laid out,{proud} this place'll be hotter than the devil's knickers!
1500)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Looks like "Ladies' Night" has picked up a bit.
1501)  GRINDSTUMP
{disappointed}Picked up a little too much for my tastes!  {confused}These she-beasts have scared away all me eligible, hard-drinking, hard-spending pirate bachelors!
1502)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Looks like Ladies Night has finally come to an end.
1503)  GRINDSTUMP
{disappointed}Aye.  I'm thinking about cancelling it in favor of something a wee bit safer…{awe} like Ultimate Mumbly Peg Night or Amateur Tattoo Night.
1504)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Tell me about this Fugu Jolokia Challenge…
1505)  GRINDSTUMP
{Awe}Arr, a connoisseur {proud}of peculiar culinary delights, are we?
1506)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Um, yes?
1507)  GRINDSTUMP
{Happy}Then you surely have heard of the Fugu Jolokia, the {Excited} hottest pepper in this world OR the next!
1508)  GUYBRUSH
Oh, THAT Fugu Jolokia!
1509)  GRINDSTUMP
{serious}I acquired THAT specimen of the Fugu Pepper many years ago from a three-legged bandit named "Oort," {Proud}winning it from him when I was able to place me tongue on the pepper for ten entire seconds.
1510)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}How eccentric.
1511)  GRINDSTUMP
{Serious}Since that tongue-destroying day, {Proud}I have vowed to pass on the pepper to the first pirate who can successfully put his tongue on the Fugu Jolokia {excited}for eleven seconds!
1512)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}I'd like to take the Fugu Jolokia Challenge!
1513)  GRINDSTUMP
{Happy}I thought you look like a man of gastronomic adventure!  {Excited}Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a challenger!
1514)  KREBBS
[off-screen] [sarcastic] Whoopee.
1515)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}Whenever you're ready, lad.
1516)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I'd like another crack at that Fugu Jojo Rococo pepper.
1517)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning}Back into the breach, eh?  {proud}Admirable spirit!
1518)  GRINDSTUMP
{Happy} Have at it!
1519)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Let's try another round with that Fuji Blagojevich thingie.
1520)  GRINDSTUMP
{Questioning}Are ya sure, lad?  {Confused}I'm starting to think you're not cut out for this-
1521)  GUYBRUSH
Set me up!
1522)  GRINDSTUMP
{Disappointed}Sigh…
1523)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Fugu me, Grindstump!
1524)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Why?
1525)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}I told you not to ask me that!
1526)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}That's a strange place for a sugar sack.
1527)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}I keep it up there to draw away the ants.
1528)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}It's Grindstump's ant-distracting sugar sack.
1529)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Just what I always wanted... {disgust}an ant-infested sack of sugar.
1530)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I bet there's nothing in there that can help bring Morgan back.
1531)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I could try to mix up those chemicals, but I'd probably just end up exploding... and not in the funny way.
1532)  GUYBRUSH
[disgusted] {disgust}Aw no...  This where the Marquis keeps all the severed limbs of the pirates he's operated on!
1533)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Hey, you never know when a sack of severed legs is gonna come in handy.  Or footy, as the case may be.
1534)  GUYBRUSH
{default}It's already unlocked.
1535)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I'm NOT going back in there.  It's gross.
1536)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Refreshing.
1537)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}This must've been broken in the fight between Morgan and De Singe.  I hope the vole escaped.
1538)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}"Auto-Trepanation Helmet..." hmmm.
1539)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ow!
1540)  GUYBRUSH
[tongue numb]{surprised} Whdda?  Manumb! ["what the?  My tongue!"]
1541)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}That's the second biggest flashback I've ever seen!
1542)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}Ack! I'm blind!
1543)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Whew!
1544)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ow!
1545)  GUYBRUSH
[process - shrinking] {confused}Whoooa!
1546)  GUYBRUSH
[process - tiny] Um, help?
1547)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}It looks like De Singe using my hand to make something called the "Jus de Vie."
1548)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}The Vaycaylian Wind Control Device?  What is that creep doing with it NOW?
1549)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}That doesn't look good.
1550)  GUYBRUSH
It's broken.
1551)  GUYBRUSH
{angry}De Singe will pay for this.
1552)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]"Lepidoptera Flotsamus Accelerus - Like many of its more common cousins, the Sharp-Toothed Flotsam Island Moth has a penchant for noshing on articles of clothing."
1553)  GUYBRUSH
"Where Flotsamus Accelerus differs is in the pain of its bites, which can be quite annoying, and the rapidity of its meals. "
1554)  GUYBRUSH
"A swarm of Flotsam Moths can strip a man down to his undergarments in mere seconds... assuming the notoriously finicky moths approve of his wardrobe, of course."
1555)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Darn, no more bananas.  Curse you, banana god.
1556)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}It'd take a seven-year correspondence course in mad sciencing before I'd even have a hope of fixing that thing.
1557)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}That's really wedged in there.
1558)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}I'd pull it out, but it's caked in all sorts of ichor.
1559)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Did De Singe murder you, too?
1560)  STAN
{Happy} Hey there, youngster!  I know you're curious about the behind-the-scenes workings of Stan's Courtroom Emporium, but I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to step away from the door!
1561)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Why?
1562)  STAN
{Smarmy} 'Cause that's where Stan works his magic, kid!  It's where my dreams become reality, and some of my realities become dreams!
1563)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} So, it's where you're sleeping?
1564)  STAN
{Confused} Yeah, but only until this souvenir business picks up.
1565)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I have no desire whatsoever to see Stan's living arrangements.
1566)  GUYBRUSH
Looks like someone's finally getting around to cleaning the carpet that got, um... {Confused}"stained..."{Default} during my bar fight.
1567)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Ah, the Gulf of Melange.
1568)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Snazzy.
1569)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I still don't know what the 41 stands for, though.
1570)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Stan, about these charges...
1571)  STAN
{Thinking} Sorry kid, can't talk!  Conflict of interest, attorney-pirate privilege and all that stuff!
1572)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} But--
1573)  STAN
La-la-la-la, I'm not talking to you about it!
1574)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Stan, about this sketch...
1575)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey, D'Oro!
1576)  DORO
{Suspicious} What?
1577)  GUYBRUSH
[sing-songy] Look what I've got...
1578)  DORO
What's that?
1579)  GUYBRUSH
A glass eye.
1580)  DORO
{Stern} What kind of a lame glass eye is that?  It doesn't even have any color!  Feh!
1581)  GUYBRUSH
[sing-songy] I've got an eye for you...
1582)  DORO
{Concerned} It's nice, but...
1583)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} But?
1584)  DORO
{Sad} I really had my heart set on a cool glass eye that glows.
1585)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Glows?
1586)  DORO
{Cocky} You know, like all the cool Poxed pirates' eyes glow when they get angry!
1587)  GUYBRUSH
You want to look like an out-of-control diseased pirate?
1588)  DORO
{Happy} Oh ho si!  Then all the pirates will fear and respect the name of Joaquin D'Oro!
1589)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey D'Oro, I've got your glass eye!
1590)  DORO
{Stern} Is it throbbing with the color of an angry Poxed pirate?
1591)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Not really...
1592)  DORO
Then I don't want it!
1593)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Captain D'Oro!
1594)  DORO
{Suspicious} Do you have it?
1595)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} One nigh-indestructible glass-eye, Pox-colored, just like all the cool pirates are wearing 'em!
1596)  DORO
{Happy} Atchison, Topeka, and{Enthused} Santa Fe!
1597)  DORO
[sung to the tune of "Aye-aye-aye-aye"] Eyyyyye, eye, eye-eye, my eye is really scary...
1598)  GUYBRUSH
Now, according to Crimpdigit, all you have to do to set it is pop it in your...
1599)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} ...eye socket.  Ew.
1600)  DORO
{Happy} How do I look?
1601)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Dangerous.
1602)  DORO
{Cocky} I think you mean dangerously COOL, eh!
1603)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Sure, whatever.  Now about your testimony...
1604)  DORO
{Default} No problem, mi amigo.  Just call me back to the stand, and ask me about THIS.
1605)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Your Dark Ninja Dave Porcelain Power Pirates Treasure Map? {Confused} How'd you smuggle THIS into here?
1606)  DORO
{Concerned} In my, um, let's say...{Sarcastic} "mouth."
1607)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Say cheese!
1608)  HARDTACK
{Happy} Yes, it does smell a bit like cheese out here, I--
1609)  HARDTACK
{Surprised} Hey!
1610)  GUYBRUSH
Thank you.
1611)  HARDTACK
{Suspicious} What are you-
1612)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey, Stan, mind if I capture your eye color for posterity?
1613)  STAN
{Happy} No problemo, Threepwood, just as long as ol' Stan gets a cut of the reproduction profits!
1614)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Um, sure...
1615)  STAN
Whoa, that really puts the spots in the ol' pupils, doesn't it?
1616)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Mind if I take another shot with the eye?  The first one didn't take.
1617)  STAN
{Happy} Shoot away, Threepwood.
1618)  GUYBRUSH
Stan,{Suspicious} I think you should look at the burns on this lamp...
1619)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} What do you think of this lamp now, Stan?
1620)  STAN
{Happy} It'd be a great little souvenir if Krebbs's case were still going on, Threepwood, but now it's nothing but another piece of kitschy crud... and believe me, I know my kitschy crud!
1621)  STAN
{Smarmy} Hey now, what's this?  A fuzzy flying fan club?
1622)  STAN
{Surprised}[reacting to getting bitten... repeatedly] Ouch!  Hey, knock it off you, nutty nibblers, that-OW!-hurts!
1623)  STAN
Sweet-ow-fancy-ow-moses!
1624)  STAN
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
1625)  STAN
{Smarmy} Well THAT was one heck of an experience, eh, Threepwood?  It's a good thing ol' Stan always keeps a few spare jackets in the back office, or I'd be defending my clients in the altogether!
1626)  STAN
Say, that's not a bad idea..."Stan S. Stanman, Naked Attorney-At-Law!  You've got nothing to hide, and neither does he!"
1627)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Umm...
1628)  STAN
No time to chat, Threepwood, I've got business cards to print!
1629)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}What the heck is De Singe doing up there, anyway?
1630)  GUYBRUSH
It's a mysterious, burning substance that I'm not touching again.
1631)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}How's the Pox treating you?
1632)  MCGEE
[feigns mildness, turns to anger] {angry} Oh not too bad.  I didn't really need that LUNG I COUGHED UP.
1633)  GUYBRUSH
Vestigial lungs are the worst.
1634)  GUYBRUSH
Hi there, Twinkletoes.
1635)  MCGEE
Enjoy your last moments of freedom, 'cause you're going to pay for what you did to Miss Prettywhiskers!
1636)  MCGEE
{worried}I'm tryin' to figure out why poor Miss Prettywhiskers won't move for me.
1637)  GUYBRUSH
[stifling a giggle]{happy} She's probably just not getting enough iron in her diet.
1638)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Drop the charges and I'll spare your life.
1639)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}How's Miss Grungywhiskers doing?
1640)  MCGEE
[going poxy]{angry} What?!  BARFYWHISKERS?!  For the last time, ya dancin' dunce, her name is Miss PRETTYWHISKERS!!!  [this last said as evil as possible]
1641)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}How's Miss Trashywhiskers doing?
1642)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}How's Miss Barfywhiskers doing?
1643)  MCGEE
{sad}Bah!  Life ain't hardly worth living without the sound of Miss Prettywhiskers' delicate pitter-pat on the bar floor.
1644)  GUYBRUSH
I'm sure she feels the same about the delicate pitter-pat of your stumps.
1645)  MCGEE
Aye.  Tore through here like a cat outta hell, off into the jungle.
1646)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}What exactly are you doing?
1647)  MCGEE
{angry}Mixing up Miss Prettywhiskers' food.  What's it to you?
1648)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Can I have some?
1649)  MCGEE
{angry}No!  [No, of course you may not!]
1650)  MCGEE
[going poxy]{angry} TRASHYWHISKERS?!  Listen up, smucker-smacker.  Her name is Miss PRETTYWHISKERS!!  [this last said super evilly]
1651)  MCGEE
[going poxy]{angry} Her name isn't GRUNGYWHISKERS ya lava licker!  It's Miss PRETTYWHISKERS!  [this last said especially evilly]
1652)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Guess what, I found the Jungle Beast!  Turns out it's a meat-eating plant!  Can you believe it?!
1653)  MCGEE
{sarcastic}Sure.  Who ever heard of a vegetarian plant?
1654)  GUYBRUSH
I hear you may know something about Flotsam's so-called "Jungle Beast."
1655)  
Guess what, I found the Jungle Beast!
1656)  MCGEE
[scary story mode]{scared} None have seen the Jungle Beast, but 'tis the scariest, foul-smellingest thing you ever didn't see: a dark jungle god that walks the land only by dead of night!
1657)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}But if you haven't seen it, how do you know it exists?
1658)  MCGEE
[scary story mode] Because... it eats!  To appease the beast, we've left many a fleshy sacrifice on the jungle altar.  By morning, the meat disappears from the altar without a trace!
1659)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}I forgot the tale of the Jungle Beast.
1660)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Disappearing meat.  Yep, jungle god's the only explanation.
1661)  MCGEE
[scary story mode]{scared} None have seen the Jungle Beast, but 'tis the scariest, foul-smellingest...  [gets interrupted]
1662)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Yeah, yeah, skip to the end.
1663)  MCGEE
[quickly finishing the story] The meat disappears from the altar without a trace.
1664)  GUYBRUSH
Good story, good story.
1665)  GUYBRUSH
I'd be happy to pay.  Do you accept traveler's cheques?
1666)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Dark jungle god?  [you can't be serious]
1667)  MCGEE
[scary story mode] Aye!  'Twas said to live within the stomach of the God of Death, feasting upon corpses, until one day Death ate some bad shellfish, and upchucked the Jungle Beast into existence!
1668)  GUYBRUSH
Hi there, Double Peg.
1669)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised} Wow... that bacon grease is STILL burning.
1670)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}It's Jacques, the electromagnetic monkey!
1671)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Don't worry, little guy, I'll liberate you... somehow.
1672)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}What kind of a madman keeps a perfectly good magnetic monkey locked in a cage?
1673)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Let's see if this'll work...
1674)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Aha!
1675)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}C'mon, let's get you out of here!
1676)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}What's that?
1677)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}Arrr, ya best watch yer step... that be a puddle of molten glass.  It'll cool down in a few seconds, but until it does, it'll melt your boots off!
1678)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I COULD row back to the Screaming Narwhal, but without La Esponja Grande I'll never be able to cure Elaine... and if I show up without Elaine's wedding ring, she'll probably kill me.
1679)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Hmm, someone sank my rowboat.  Probably one of Flotsam's Poxed pirates.
1680)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "The Doctor is BUSY!!!!!"
1681)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}He must be REALLY busy if he needs all those exclamation points.
1682)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "The Doctor is OUT!"
1683)  GUYBRUSH
[serious]{cocky} Out of his freaking MIND, maybe.
1684)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Ohh, now I get it.
1685)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}You wouldn't expect pirates to be so punny.
1686)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}While there may be many locks I can pick with my spiffy hook, this isn't one of them.
1687)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Hemlock's cat is catatonic enough without adding mixed drinks to the equation.
1688)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}That looks unappetizing.
1689)  MCGEE
{angry}Stay away from Miss Prettywhiskers's food, ya fiend!
1690)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Your cat eats that?  I thought she was paralyzed?
1691)  MCGEE
{angry}She is!  I have to feed it to her through a straw!
1692)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}What are those sprinkly flakes in there?
1693)  MCGEE
{happy}Candy sprinkles.  Miss Prettywhiskers loves her little candy sprinkles!
1694)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky} I hope Miss Prettywhiskers likes all the iron I've added to her diet.
1695)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hey look, a five-headed bonobo!
1696)  MCGEE
{confused}What?
1697)  MCGEE
{angry}I didn't see nothin'
1698)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Sorry, must have been a weather balloon.
1699)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I think I've fortified that cat food with enough iron as it is.
1700)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ooh, sizzly.
1701)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Y'know, if I was a little more scientifically inclined, I might be worried about the effects this stuff is having on any future generations of Threepwoods.
1702)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I've already got enough of that sizzling goo for my needs.
1703)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I've just GOT to get some of this incredible bacon grease.
1704)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}There.  Now my jacket AND my pants smell like bacon.
1705)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I better get some of this before it cools.
1706)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Mmm, warm.
1707)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I've got all the liquid bacon grease I need right now.
1708)  GUYBRUSH
I've already got enough molten glass in my pants for all my molten glass needs.
1709)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}Hey!
1710)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Hey, Hemlock, mind if I get capture your eye color?
1711)  MCGEE
{angry}Hey!
1712)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky} That's really, um, something.
1713)  CRIMPDIGIT
{happy}Aye, isn't she a beauty?  It's a prototype of my Swashbuckling Suzy Long-Lasting Leg Lamp!  That crystal on the top'll glow for days!
1714)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous} Don't you think it's a little... tacky?
1715)  CRIMPDIGIT
{enthused} Nay, pirates LOVE this kind of stuff!
1716)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Look!  An eight-legged alpaca!
1717)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}Yer fancy cryptozoology tricks won't fool me, laddie!
1718)  DESINGE
[process through tube] Bonjour!
1719)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Um-
1720)  DESINGE
[process through tube] [angry]Threepwood!  Stay away from my laboritorium!
1721)  GUYBRUSH
[faux-clumsily] {surprised}Oops.
1722)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}Arr, now look at what ya did!
1723)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}Arrrr!
1724)  CRIMPDIGIT
[poxy]{angry} Ya clumsy clam-clipper!  Ya ruined me prototype!  Now I have to start all over!  Arrrr!
1725)  GUYBRUSH
[sheepish]{whiney} So, if it's messed up, can I have it?
1726)  CRIMPDIGIT
[poxy] Fine!  Take it!  Just get out of me sight!  Arrrr!
1727)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}This oughtta help me get a "leg up" in the trial.
1728)  GUYBRUSH
Morgan left Mister Winslow circling the island, just outside the reach of Flotsam's winds.
1729)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} [peering into dark cell]Hello?
1730)  DORO
{Stern} You!
1731)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} D'Oro?
1732)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What happened to your eye?
1733)  DORO
{Stern} I'll tell you what happened to my eye, smarty guy!  When I dug up that phony Dark Ninja Dave you planted-
1734)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Allegedly planted!
1735)  DORO
{Sarcastic} "Allegedly" planted,{Stern} I got a speck of dirt lodged in my eye.  A week later it got infected, and Doctor De Singe had to cut it out!
1736)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}[muttering] Yeah, I'll just bet he did.
1737)  DORO
{Concerned} Now I need a glass eye!
1738)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Why do you want a glass eye? {Cocky} An eyepatch is much more pirate-y.
1739)  DORO
{Sarcastic} Eyepatches are so last month. {Cocky} All the cool pirates are getting scary glass eyes these days.
1740)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} But hooks are still cool right? {Stern} Grrr!
1741)  DORO
{Sarcastic} I guess...{Cocky} but you really can't beat a glass eye.
1742)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} What're you in for?
1743)  DORO
{Sad} I got arrested for trying to auction a counterfeit Dark Ninja Dave Figurine at Ye Bay.
1744)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Ye Bay?
1745)  DORO
{Cocky} You know, that bay with the auction thing.
1746)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Oh yeah.
1747)  DORO
{Happy} Luckily for me, Stan got me a reduced sentence in exchange for my testimony against you!
1748)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Me? {Confused} What'd I do?
1749)  DORO
{Angry} You were the one who made that counterfeit Dave in the first place!
1750)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Oh yeah, that.
1751)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Look, I'm sorry about the jail time, but you've got to stop testifying against me!  I've got a wife and scores of pirates to cure!
1752)  DORO
{Surprised} You're going to cure the Pox?
1753)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Eventually, yeah.
1754)  DORO
{Happy} Ooh, I'd like that. {Sad} All these Poxed pirates are always making fun of me for not being Poxed.
1755)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Well c'mon then.  Let's do some business.
1756)  DORO
{Suspicious} Maybe... what can you offer me in return?
1757)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Let me get back to you on that.
1758)  DORO
{Stern}[annoyed] Fine.
1759)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Are you still open to a bribe to shut down your testimony against me?
1760)  DORO
{Suspicious} Maybe... what are you offering?
1761)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I've got a line on a genuine Dark Ninja Dave Porcelain Power Pirate,{Happy} autographed by Dark Ninja Dave Himself!
1762)  DORO
{Stern} That is a very poor joke, señor.
1763)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I'll let you have your pick of my autographed sextants!
1764)  DORO
{Enthused} Ooh, do you have one to those limited edition Vasco De Llama sextants?
1765)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Yeah, but you can't have that one.
1766)  DORO
What about the Ferdinand Majelly Anne Quad-Action sextants, hmmm?
1767)  GUYBRUSH
Yeah, but you can't have that one, either.
1768)  GUYBRUSH
On second thought,{Embarrassed} I really don't want to part with my sextants.
1769)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I've got a crate full of fine leather jackets back in my hold that have your name all over them.
1770)  DORO
{Suspicious} No thanks.  Leather makes me chafe.
1771)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} How about I get you a glass eye for your eye hole?
1772)  DORO
That sounds...{Sarcastic} interesting.
1773)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Then it's a deal!
1774)  DORO
{Concerned} But!
1775)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I knew there'd be a big, noisy "but" somewhere in there.
1776)  DORO
{Happy} I want a really cool glass eye!
1777)  GUYBRUSH
And what, pray tell, makes a "cool" glass eye?
1778)  DORO
{Enthused} It has to have a really cool color, like the color in the eyes of those nasty Poxed pirates when they're really REALLY angry.
1779)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} I'll see what I can do.
1780)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Y'know, I can't help but notice that you don't seem to be afflicted by the Pox of LeChuck.
1781)  DORO
{Stern} Ahhh don't remind me. {Sad} All the other pirates have gotten the Pox, so why not me?
1782)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Have you thought about the possibility that you might not actually be a pirate?
1783)  DORO
{Angry} I am too a pirate!
1784)  GUYBRUSH

1794)  GUYBRUSH
Without my hand to supply him with his "Jus de Vie," all those wounds you've been inflicting are starting to catch up with him.

Aha!  I have you now, my pretty!
1797)  DESINGE
Aieeeeeeeeeee!
1798)  GUYBRUSH
Nice one, hand!  Care to help me with these locks?
1799)  GUYBRUSH
Guess that was a little too much to ask.  At least I've got the Sponge back, though.
1800)  GUYBRUSH
[incredulous] THAT'S the legendary Jungle Beast of Flotsam Island?
1801)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Save it.
1802)  VOODOOLADY
While searching for a cure to the pirate-afflicting Pox of LeChuck, the fates of Guybrush Threepwood and Morgan LeFlay are blown off-course when they are swallowed by a lovelorn leviathan…
1803)  VOODOOLADY
Much to Morgan and Guybrush's surprise, an uneasy alliance to escape the beast blossoms into a genuine friendship between the pirate and the pirate hunter... a tidal shift that leads Threepwood to the elusive Pox-curing Esponja Grande...
1804)  VOODOOLADY
But Guybrush learns too late that it is the wise pirate who  prepares for the inevitable change in the winds, as Morgan betrays him and returns him to the scientific clutches of the Marquis De Singe...

All this courtroom drama has made me thirsty.

My pirate-y plunder sense is tingling, arrr!

I wonder what other treasures I can steal, er, liberate from here?
1859)  GUYBRUSH
The faster I clear my name of these ridiculous charges, the faster I'll be free to cure Elaine with La Esponja Grande!

I wonder if there's anything useful in those legal briefs.

Hardtack's not too bright... I bet he'd fall apart on the stand like a cheap leather jacket.

I'm sorry, {proud} lad, but I preside over a PIRATE court, meting out justice exclusively for pirate-on-pirate crimes.  {Confused}This sounds like a case of mad scientist-on-privateer violence... {serious}totally out of my jurisdiction, you see.

Then, after infecting everyone in sight, the Pox cloud {Cocky} "magically" blew away at exactly {Thinking} the same moment that Guybrush sailed away ({Cocky}stealing Flotsam's only ship, I might add).
1931)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Hey, I won that ship fair and square!
1932)  STAN
{Confused} Now Threepwood has returned, and so has the Cloud of Pox!  [sarcastic] {Cocky} What a coincidence! {Confused} And yet here he stands, concocting fanciful stories of a human LeChuck, voodoo cutlasses, and a so-called "Rock of Gelato."
1933)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Well, it's not my fault.
1934)  GALLERY3
That's right!
1935)  GUYBRUSH
Now that the winds are blowing in again, Flotsam Island is once more soaking up most of the Pox of LeChuck.

1942)  DESINGE
[exasperated]  But you must break Threepwood out of jail and bring him back to me!  He is the only one who has the poxilicious strain that I need!

2033)  HARDTACK
Oof!
2034)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} ...Take exception...
2035)  HARDTACK
{Sad} I'll tell you what happened! {Concerned} I went to Club 41 to hand this summons to your better half,{Scared} and she backhanded me right out of the bar!
2036)  HARDTACK
{Sad} I'm gonna go see if the local doctor can fix me jawbone...
2037)  GUYBRUSH
Club 41 uses these insulated cups to keep their Blood Island Volcano Shots from cooling down.
2038)  GUYBRUSH
Seems simple enough.
2039)  GUYBRUSH
I haven't been trained to properly give enigmatic-yet-portentous tarot card readings.
2040)  GUYBRUSH
This summons will only work on Elaine!
2041)  GUYBRUSH
La Esponja Grande won't work on anyone until it's been fed its "Feast for the Senses."
2042)  GUYBRUSH
I'm not giving that away... it might be important!
2043)  GUYBRUSH
I should probably give this to a professional.
2044)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm.  Looks complicated.
2045)  GUYBRUSH
I better keep these court papers to myself.
2046)  GUYBRUSH
I better keep these court papers to myself.
2047)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think they'd appreciate getting impaled on my hook.
2048)  GUYBRUSH
I don't want to show my monkey to anyone until the time is right.
2049)  GUYBRUSH
Nah. Sure, it'd be fun to watch them run off and stick their head in the nearest body of water, but after the third or fourth time it'd just be a little sad.
2050)  GUYBRUSH
I'm not giving away the key to enlargening the Sponge!
2051)  GUYBRUSH
[disgusted]{Disgust} Pyew!  What's that smell?
2052)  GUYBRUSH
[disgusted]{Disgust} Whew!  Something in this jungle reeks!
2053)  GUYBRUSH
[disgusted]{Disgust} Man, something out here cut the cheese... then died.
2054)  GUYBRUSH
I better fold this up before I put it in my pocket.
2055)  GUYBRUSH
That's odd...
2056)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm.  It's like a whole new map now.
2057)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused}That's weird... the trail didn't go anywhere.
2058)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} That's strange... I could swear that path used to lead somewhere else.
2059)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} What a shame... {incredulous} that rug really tied the shack together.
2060)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I think that the rug is more of a symbol than an actual voodoo artifact.  Besides, it's been torn apart by moths.
2061)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} That probably explains what happened to the Voodoo Lady's rug.
2062)  KREBBS
{annoyed}What do you want?
2063)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You're not upset about the trial, are you?
2064)  KREBBS
{serious}Why would I possibly be upset by the fact that I {annoyed}hideously disfigured myself in a quest for long-delayed vengeance, only to have it cruelly snatched away at the last moment?
2065)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}About your quest for vengeance... {embarrassed}I'm afraid I still don't remember you.
2066)  KREBBS
{surprised}[incredulous] You... don't... remember?
2067)  KREBBS
How could ya forget how you sank me marlin-huntin' ship off the coast of Snark Island?  {annoyed}Or the time you framed me for mopery on Wirtling Shores?
2068)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Unless I've taken too many blows to the head, {suspicious}I'm pretty sure I've never been any of those places, {incredulous}or done any of those things.
2069)  KREBBS
{surprised}Well, you may not remember {serious}Bosun Kathryn C. Krebbs, {annoyed}but you can be sure that there'll always be a black mark next to the name of Guybrush Q. Threepwood!
2070)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Wait, did you say [emphasize the Q] "Guybrush {surprised}Q. Threepwood?"
2071)  KREBBS
{evil}Aye, and a fouler name never escaped me lips.
2072)  KREBBS
{surprised}What?
2073)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Yeah.  Your vendetta must be with {incredulous}the OTHER Guybrush Threepwood.  I should've realized.  {confused}Y'know this isn't the first time something like this has happened...{suspicious}[musing]I keep getting his mail, too...
2074)  KREBBS
{evil}[going poxy] ArrrrrrRRRRRRR!
2075)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}You're not still upset about the whole {suspicious}hideously scarring your leg in a bid to seek unholy vengeance against the wrong target thing, are you?
2076)  
La Esponja Grande
2077)  DESINGE
Ah-ah-ah, little hand!  It's no use trying to escape my turban!
2078)  ELAINE
Arrrr!  Don't just stand there like a stupid-looking statue!  Toss the Sponge into that machinery so that we can go home and I can ravish you properly!  Arrr!
2079)  DESINGE
Whew!  All this defiling of nature is thirsty work!
2080)  GUYBRUSH
It's a good thing De Singe brought a bucket of water out here… I'm gonna be thirsty after all this tromping through the jungle.
2081)  GUYBRUSH
That turban's almost as snazzy as Stan's jacket.
2082)  GUYBRUSH
"Shocking" taste?
2083)  GUYBRUSH
Sixth Sense?  Who do I know with six senses?
2084)  GUYBRUSH
Maybe I should look at that menu again for clues about the Sixth Sense.
2085)  GUYBRUSH
[tongue becoming un-numb]Dahhh-dah-dah…[makes head shaking noise]
2086)  GRINDSTUMP
{questioning}What's that?
2087)  GRINDSTUMP
{confused}You want to take the Fugu Jolokia Challenge?
2088)  GRINDSTUMP
{proud}Why didn't you say so!  {happy}Have at it, Captain!
2089)  GUYBRUSH
Normally I drink a good stiff grog to steady myself for spicy foods, but I don't that'll be enough in this case.
2090)  GUYBRUSH
It's a good thing one of these senses is taste, 'cause all this adventuring is making me hungry.
2091)  GUYBRUSH
Something in that jungle smells…
2092)  GUYBRUSH
Hemlock used to explore Flotsam's jungle… maybe he can tell me what smells so bad.
2093)  GUYBRUSH
Maybe I can track the Jungle Beast if I give it something to eat.
2094)  GUYBRUSH
Maybe something in the Marquis' lab can give me some help with this so-called "Jungle Beast."
2095)  GUYBRUSH
I'd sure like to see some LIVING specimens of those Flotsam Jungle Fireflies.
2096)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I can't believe Stan's still wearing the same jacket…{Confused} and that it's still so shiny.
2097)  GUYBRUSH
Stan'll never give me his jacket voluntarily.
2098)  GUYBRUSH
The Voodoo Lady's gonna be annoyed when sees what those moths did to her rug.
2099)  GUYBRUSH
I can't believe the judge took all my cool cups full of burning stuff, and left me with this useless lamp!
2100)  STAN
{Smarmy} Step right up and feast your eyes on Stan's All-New Line-Up of Trial of the Century Paraphernalia!
2101)  GUYBRUSH
Maybe if I cure Elaine she'll be a better witness…
2102)  GRINDSTUMP
You don't actually have to hand it to her directly, just get it into her hands!
2103)  MORGAN
Can't you just "use something with something" here?
2104)  MORGAN
Hey!  Watch where you're flinging those darts!
2105)  ELAINE
Arrr!  I almost got your skanky jacket caught on me sword!
2106)  GRINDSTUMP
While the defense is lollygagging, I'd like to remind everyone that the court strenuously frowns on flash photography.
2107)  GUYBRUSH
What the heck is the Marquis up to in his lab?
2108)  GUYBRUSH
As much as it creeps me out, I think I better take another look in De Singe's lab.
2109)  GUYBRUSH
I think I may have missed something out in the jungle.
2110)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Hey, Krebbs, now that your case has been dismissed, {incredulous}care to join me in a little post-trial amicus curae?
2111)  KREBBS
{sarcastic}Was that a pick-up line?
2112)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I don't know... {confused}my Latin's a little rusty.
2113)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[creepy suave] Tell me, did it hurt?
2114)  MORGAN
{serious}I may be a backstabbing mercenary, {stern}but even I have SOME standards.
2115)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Sure, NOW you have standards.  Shame they couldn't have shown up before you, oh, cut off my hand or {angry}knocked me unconscious and dragged me back to Flotsam Island.
2116)  MORGAN
What can I say?  I'm complicated.{default}
2117)  MORGAN
{default}You heard the man, something to do with your {questioning}[does silly De Singe French accent] "unique strain of Pox."  {serious}Guess he thinks your wife has it, too.{default}
2118)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[annoyed] Of course, how silly of me.  {stern}It's all about the pieces of eight with you, isn't it?{default}
2119)  MORGAN
Not always. I also accept pieces of nine.{default}
2120)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} But why?
2121)  HARDTACK
{Worried} Well, I didn't have anything else to do after you killed me boss and left me without a job.  [Realizing] {Surprised} Awww, {Stern} I could have charged you with that instead! *sigh*
2122)  GUYBRUSH
I saw you run out of the lab after you murdered her!
2123)  DESINGE
{Amazed} Of course I ran out of my lab!   {Arrogant} There was blood all over the floor instead of being packed neatly in vials where it belongs!
2124)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Sorry about that...
2125)  CRIMPDIGIT
{default}You just point 'em at someone's eyes, give 'em a few seconds to set, and shazam, all new eye color.  When ya got a color you like, just pop it in your eye socket, and it'll stay that way forever.
2126)  CRIMPDIGIT
{default}Aye.  It's a little nearsighted, so you'll have to get up real close to the subject to capture their eye color.
2127)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Thanks!  I take back all the nasty things I wrote in my diary about you!
2128)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}You got THAT right, missy.
2129)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Hey, you used to explore Flotsam's jungles until you lost your legs, right?
2130)  MCGEE
{cocky}Yeah, so?
2131)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}So, maybe you can tell me why the jungle's started to stink more than LeChuck's bloomers?
2132)  LECHUCK
[v-over][shouting] I heard that!
2133)  GUYBRUSH
[shouting] Sorry!
2134)  MCGEE
{worried}Aye, that'd be the Jungle Beast of Flotsam Island.
2135)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Jungle Beast?
2136)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Nice to see ONE female pirate in this bar isn't a{suspicious} fight-crazed whackadoodle.
2137)  KREBBS
{surprised}Oh, I am... {serious}I'm just loading up on carbs before joining the fight.  {sarcastic}Doesn't pay to have a sugar drop in the middle of one of these things, y'know.
2138)  ELAINE
{evil}Stay away from Guybrush, ya sea-hog!
2139)  MORGAN
{strained}Stay away from Guybrush, ya sea-hog!
2140)  ELAINE
{evil}Arrr!{default}
2141)  MORGAN

2142)  KREBBS

2144)  MORGAN
{fierce}Haha!  Gimmie!
2145)  KREBBS
[process - muffled by door] Occupied!
2146)  KREBBS
{confused}Did what hurt?
2147)  GUYBRUSH
[creepy suave]When you fell out of pirate heaven?
2148)  KREBBS
{annoyed}No, but THIS will...
2149)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[creepy suave]  Whatcha gonna do with all that gold?
2150)  KREBBS
{surprised}All what gold?
2151)  GUYBRUSH
[creepy suave]All that gold inside your chest-
2152)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[creppy suave] Hey, beautiful...
2153)  KREBBS
{annoyed}Arr.
2154)  STAN
{Annoyed} Your honor, I object!  Defense is grasping at sponge-shaped straws here.
2155)  LECHUCK
{Pleading} But wait, there's more!
2156)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm still confused about what I need for this napkin...
2157)  VOODOOLADY
{Stern}[exasperated] Are you so blind that you cannot see the wondrous sights that are right in front of you?
2158)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I still don't know what I should be looking for,{Suspicious} from an antepasta perspective.
2159)  VOODOOLADY
In my brief dealings with Hemlock McGee, he told me of a {Mystical}legendarily pungent "Jungle Beast" lurking in Flotsam's foliage. {Default} Perhaps you should seek him out.
2160)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm still drawing a blank about the powerful taste.
2161)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} I sense it somewhere in Club 41.
2162)  VOODOOLADY
You already hold the answer to that question.
2163)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} This "sixth sense" stuff is still a little murky...{Whiney} actually, it's a lot murky.
2164)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} The menu is your key. {Default} Consider it carefully.
2165)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Where am going to find a shock around here?  {Incredulous}There don't seem to be any lightning in the forecast.
2166)  VOODOOLADY
{Mystical} Such tactile sensations can be found in the strangest of places. {Stern} But don't drag your feet, Threepwood... time is running out!
2167)  LECHUCK
Looks like we'll be doing this "with" all that voodoo...

Club 41
2340)  
Courtroom
2341)  
Betrayed by pirate hunter/biggest fan Morgan LeFlay, Guybrush Threepwood is delivered to the clutches of the Marquis De Singe on Flotsam Island.  But before the Threepwood-obsessed scientist can begin his painful experiments, the Mighty Pirate™ is hauled before the Pirate Court of Flotsam Island and accused of various execution-worthy crimes!
2342)  
Guybrush makes quick work of Hardtack's preposterous claim of X-Rated vandalism, breaking him down on the stand like a house of cards.
2343)  
Bosun Krebbs' case is dismissed after Guybrush's methodical forensic analysis proves that her horrifying (yet oddly colorful) burns were NOT caused by Club 41's famous nacho sauce.
2344)  
Hemlock's case is dismissed after Guybrush tampers with his fear-stiffened cat, causing it to seemingly spring to life in open court.
2345)  
Guybrush bribes star witness Joaquin D'Oro with a "really cool" glass eye, forcing Stan to drop a counterfeiting case against our hero.
2346)  
Just as Guybrush is hit with the biggest charge of all (Spreading the Pox of LeChuck), Elaine arrives on Flotsam Island, crazed with the Pox and looking for the blood of Morgan LeFlay!  Guybrush thinks she'll make an ideal witness, but first he's got to drag her keister to court with a Voodoo Summons!
2347)  
Guybrush cleverly figures out how to get Elaine to grab the Summons, but she's proving to be an extremely hostile witness...
2348)  
When Guybrush finally tries to use La Esponja Grande on the extremely Pox-ridden Elaine, nothing happens!  Luckily, LeChuck arrives just in time to save Guybrush from the gallows, nobly throwing himself (and the Voodoo Lady!) on the mercy of Flotsam's execution-happy legal system.  With his oldest friend and oldest enemy now in prison, Guybrush must figure out what went wrong with the sponge, so that he can finally cure the Pox of LeChuck!
2349)  
After obtaining a "Feast for the Senses" menu from the Voodoo Lady, Guybrush sics some moths on Stan's eye-gouging jacket, and ties the scraps around the sponge to make a napkin.
2350)  
In the heart of Flotsam's jungle, Guybrush removes a stinky lion's paw from a beast's thorn, and feeds the ante-paw-sta to the sponge.
2351)  
With the help of De Singe's auto-trepanation helmet, Guybrush acquires the scalding Fugu Jolokia, and uses it to cleanse the Sponge's palate.
2352)  
Using the menu itself to bend time and space, Guybrush discovers the Voodoo Lady's fortune telling tarot cards in a hidden clearing, and sprinkles them on the Sponge, which grows ever bigger.
2353)  
After building up a huge static charge on Club 41's carpet, Guybrush shocks the sponge, bringing it ever-closer to maturity.
2354)  
With La Esponja nearly entirely Grande, Guybrush heads to the Vaycaylian Wind Control Machine to feed it the final noisy meal... only to be ensnared with Elaine by the utterly insane plans of the Marquis De Singe!
2355)  
Guybrush attempts to toss La Esponja Grande into the Vaycaylian Machine, only to have the Sponge snatched away by his severed hand, perched upon De Singe's head!  The Marquis reveals his scheme to atomize Elaine and spread the Threepwood Strain of the Pox across the Caribbean!
2356)  
With De Singe destroyed by his own devices, the world holds its breath, waiting for Guybrush to complete the Feast for the Senses and cure the Pox of LeChuck once and for all...

[pickup1] I better get back into court and introduce this disturbingly moist map into evidence.

2367)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Still, it's good to know that the moths can be attracted by the fireflies.  I'll have to file that away for later.
2368)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I don't think I want to sacrifice any more fireflies to those ravenous moths right now.
2369)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] It's a good thing those fashion-conscious moths don't appreciate my clothes, or my pockets would have more holes than the Albert Hall.

C'mon, gimme your jacket.

I see you've got some new souvenirs.

Can I take another look at your new gewgaws?

Bye.

Did you feel anything "strange" while I was with De Cava?
2626)  
I'd like to go into the jungle.
2627)  
Why are you lying about me in court?
2628)  
Why aren't you back on Spinner Cay?

Why do you want a glass eye?

Pistalibre's Journal,

Despite repeated efforts to lace bait with tracking elements, Beast's spoor remains indistinguishable from jungle floor.

Oh, if only the Beast left a path as bright as Flotsam's
Beautiful Jungle Fireflies!

Wait… what's that smell?

Witness: K. Hardtack
2646)  
Charge: Consonant Abuse (X-Class)

Plaintiff's charge that Defendant "Ruined his perfectly good X" is suspect, but plausible.  Court hopes he's not just making things up.

Rec. Sentence: 2p Fine, Death by Hanging
2647)  
Witness: K. Krebbs
2648)  
Charge: Thigh Crimes & Misdemeanors 

Discontinuation of Club 41's nacho sauce makes proof of guilt difficult, but Court deems it unlikely that some other mix of fluids could have caused Krebbs' distinctive burn.

Rec. Sentence: 23g Fine, Death by Corset
2649)  
Witness: H. McGee
2650)  
Charge: Felonious Feline Frightening

Plaintiff's pussycat seems traumatized, but Court has seen far too many "crippled"  pirates miraculously healed by the tonic of a cash settlement.  If that kitty moves an inch, this case is over.

Rec. Sentence:  1 Ball of Yarn, Death by Mauling
2651)  
Witness: J. D'Oro
2652)  
Charge: Counterfeit Collectibles

Witness testifying in return for lighter sentence. Court doesn't trust stool parrots - their testimony is only as firm as their last bribe.

Rec. Sentence: Confiscation of Sextants, Death by 8-Sided Dice
2653)  
Witness: G. Threepwood
2654)  
Defendant arrested in possession of tiny sea sponge which he insists will cure the Pox.  Court is skeptical, but has confiscated artifact as matter of policy.

Defendant also in possession of unremarkable wedding ring that will likely be used to defray his funeral costs.
