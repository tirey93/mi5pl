70)  GUYBRUSH
It's Pink Pajama Pierre, one of D'oro's Porcelain Power Pirate "action figures."
71)  GUYBRUSH
Pink Pajama Pierre looks a little more menacing in inky black pajamas, but he still needs some accessorizing.
72)  GUYBRUSH
Even with a sword, Pink Pajama Pierre isn't gonna scare anyone in those pink pajamas.
73)  GUYBRUSH
Nothing like a quick paint job and a dangerously pointy accessory to turn a sad unwanted doll into an exciting ninja assassin!
74)  GUYBRUSH
It's a mysterious ancient instrument for breaking mysterious ancient crystals.
75)  GUYBRUSH
I just bet that Hemlock's map holds the secret to getting off this island and back to Elaine... but how will I get it out of that unbreakable bottle?
76)  GUYBRUSH
Ick, this cheese wheel's starting to go soft.  Maybe I shouldn't be storing it in my pants.
77)  GUYBRUSH
It's a cheese wheel with blood-and-milk curdling impressions of ancient eyeball carvings.
78)  GUYBRUSH
For such an exclusive club, you'd think they'd have higher quality membership cards.
79)  GUYBRUSH
I wonder what the artist was trying to say with this flower pot?  Other than "I need some more pottery lessons," of course.
80)  GUYBRUSH
What the!?
81)  GUYBRUSH
It's a tiny grogatini sword with an olive.
82)  GUYBRUSH
Once I get off this stupid island and find Elaine, I guess I'm gonna have to track down this De Cava guy so I can find La Esponja Grande.
83)  GUYBRUSH
De Singe used this thingamabob to open up that giant stone door... I wonder if it opens anything else?
84)  GUYBRUSH
It's an all-purpose tool used by the ancient Flotsam Islanders to activate their mysterious machines.
85)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm.
86)  GUYBRUSH
Interesting.
87)  GUYBRUSH
I see.
88)  GUYBRUSH
These thing could knock a pirate on his or her rear.
89)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, a bomb with a burning fuse... maybe I should get rid of it...
90)  GUYBRUSH
Polly want a cracker?
91)  GUYBRUSH
It's a U-shaped  tube. The U must stand for "unbreakable," I guess.
92)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Yow!
93)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Elaine here I come!
94)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Or, um... maybe not.
95)  GUYBRUSH
Hey, whaddaya know, that little teeny sword fits right into Pierre's little teeny hand!
96)  GUYBRUSH
He still doesn't look very fearsome, though.
97)  GUYBRUSH
Hm.  Between the cool black tights and the dangerously pointy accessory, Pajama Pants Pierre is starting to look halfway collectible.
98)  GUYBRUSH
[moaning weakly] Elaiiiine...
99)  MARSHALL
{Happy} Ahoy there, me hearty!
100)  GUYBRUSH
[groggy] {Confused} Wha?
101)  MARSHALL
Don't worry, we'll have you up and suckin' back a grog in--
102)  MARSHALL
{Angry}[sounding like a guy who's covering his broken nose] Ow!  Ma nose! {Worried} Me beautiful pirate nose! {Angry} I'll get you for this, ya craven bilge rat!
103)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Sorry!  I don't know what got [he sees his diseased hand]{Worried}... into... me.
104)  GUYBRUSH
[staring at his upraised icky hand] {Stern} Oh, this can't be good...
105)  NIPPERKIN
{Default}You really should have that looked at, kid!
106)  NIPPERKIN
{Sarcastic} The name's Nipperkin, {Enthused} Davey Nipperkin, {Default} senior reporter, Keelhauler Gazette.  Welcome to Flotsam Island. {Suspicious} Mind if I ask you a few questions?
107)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Actually--
108)  NIPPERKIN
{Enthused} Great!  What's your name, where'd you come from, and how'd you get here?
109)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} Well, I don't know how you did it Seepwood, but thanks to you I've got enough sordid swashbuckling stories to keep the{Enthused}  Flotsam Keelhauler Gazette afloat for months!  {Suspicious} That'll show those bozos over at the Times!
110)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Yeah, that's, um, great.  {Default} Now about Deep Gut...
111)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} My pleasure, Threepwood... sit tight while I make you a copy...
112)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Copy?
113)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} Here ya go, kid - everything you need to know to contact Deep Gut.  {Suspicious} Don't let anyone know I gave this to you, or my editor'll put me on deep cover on the obituary beat,{Cocky} if you catch my drift.
114)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Finally!  Now I can ask this Deep Gut person how to get off this island, and back to Elaine!
115)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "Attention:  Club 41, Flotsam Island's most prestigious pirate organization, is no longer accepting new applications for membership.  Thank you for your continued interest, and please go away."
116)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} "Club 41..." {Confused} I wonder what the 41 stands for?
117)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "Hear ye, hear ye!  Owing to the unprecedented downturn in criminal activity on Flotsam Island, I've locked up the courthouse and taken a long-delayed three month sabbatical.  Please don't break any laws until I return... or else.  Sincerely, Judge Grindstump."
118)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Hmm, I guess court isn't in session today... {Incredulous} which is probably a good thing considering all the laws I'll be breaking.
119)  GUYBRUSH
Patchy.
120)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} From the jails, the flag, and the general air of perverted justice, {Default} I can only guess that this must be the Flotsam Island courthouse.
121)  GUYBRUSH
[creeped out] Whoever built this jail really wanted to put the "brrr" in "brig."  Those eye carvings are creepy!
122)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I don't know what's creepier... those eyes or {Disgust} the little flecks of cheese on them.
123)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} It's an empty, smelly jail cell, kind of like the ones back on Melee Island™...
124)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} [wistfully] Good times...
125)  GUYBRUSH
[In mock evil pirate voice, as though playing with dolls] {Stern} Arrr, Pink Pajamas Pierre, you foiled me plans for the last time!  Prepare to meet your maker in the ebon depths of the Inky Sea!
126)  GUYBRUSH
[In weird French voice, as the action figure is lowered into the ink, simulating drowning] {Worried} Sacre bleu!  Eez zis ze end of Pink...Pajama...Pierre?  Glug!
127)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Hmm.  I guess it's true.  Black really IS slimming.
128)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I know what would cheer up these gruesome carvings. {Happy} Cheese!
129)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Nope, still menacing.
130)  GUYBRUSH
[disgusted] {Disgust} Aw, and now my cheese wheel is staring at me...
131)  GUYBRUSH
Printer's ink... the life blood of the newspaper industry, lovingly harvested from squid udders.
132)  NIPPERKIN
[filter: from inside]Timmy, get me a copy of the Deep Gut file, pronto!
133)  NIPPERKIN
[filter: from inside][Obviously impersonating a non-existent junior staffer] Right away, Mister Nipperkin!
134)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]"The Flotsam Keelhauler Gazette - All the News that Floats, We'll Print"
135)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]N-E-W-S... {Happy} hey, the wind directions spell "news!"  {Suspicious}  This MEANS something.
136)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} That's easily one of the five or six biggest printing presses I've ever seen.
137)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} Ain't she a beauty?  {Sarcastic} Of course, she'd be even more impressive if we had any swashbuckling pirate news to print.
138)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} It's nice to see the Keelhauler printing press back in action... {Suspicious} I wonder if I should've held out for some royalties.
139)  GUYBRUSH
Mister Winslow, make way for...
140)  GUYBRUSH
...Heh-heh...[proud] The Rock of Gelato!
141)  WINSLOW
[enthusiaistic] Aye-aye, captain!
142)  GUYBRUSH
And get me some grog for this hand!
143)  GUYBRUSH
Winslow!
144)  WINSLOW
Captain?
145)  GUYBRUSH
Just go where I point!
146)  GUYBRUSH
[surprised] Hey!
147)  GUYBRUSH
[wrestling with hand] Grrr...
148)  GUYBRUSH
[getting decked] Yooooow!
149)  GUYBRUSH
[annoyed] Oh come on!
150)  GUYBRUSH
[wrestling with hand] Stupid...poxed...hand...
151)  GUYBRUSH
What the -?
152)  WINSLOW
Sir?
153)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1][read with urgency] Set a course for here!
154)  GUYBRUSH
[getting decked] Whoah!
155)  GUYBRUSH
[landing] Ow.
156)  GUYBRUSH
Whoah!
157)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1][read with urgency]Mr. Van Winslow, set sail for the [hand covers mouth] mpph mph mph mph-mph!
158)  WINSLOW
What's that, sir?
159)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1][read with urgency]I said, make way to the [hand covers mouth] mph mph mphmph!
160)  GUYBRUSH
Well, that's not gonna work.
161)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Hey, it's one of those spiffy new Hungarian Easy-Action Cannons{default} I've been begging Elaine to let me buy.
162)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Whoah, the wind's really doing a number on that cannonball.
163)  CRIMPDIGIT
[from a great distance] Ieeee!
164)  GUYBRUSH
Nothing like a deafening cannon discharge to clear the mind.
165)  GUYBRUSH
I'll sleep when I'm dead.  Or later tonight.
166)  GUYBRUSH
Ow!
167)  GUYBRUSH
That's what I call a sticky situation!
168)  GUYBRUSH
That's a tightly-sealed barrel of tar, used for patching up cracks and hazing bosons.
169)  GUYBRUSH
That's one strong barrel!
170)  GUYBRUSH
Yes, it's rollicking pirate adventure for me!  Just as soon as the winds start blowing away from the island.
171)  GUYBRUSH
I could raise the anchor now, but without a seaward wind, what's the point?
172)  GUYBRUSH
This is no time to lower the anchor, I've got to go to the Rock of Gelato!
173)  GUYBRUSH
That's the mainmast of the Screaming Narwhal.  Or maintree.
174)  GUYBRUSH
Argh.  I HATE scrubbing tar off my mainmast.
175)  GUYBRUSH
[straining] Can't... reach... tar... sticking... pronouns... failing...
176)  GUYBRUSH
Guess I'm stuck.
177)  GUYBRUSH
[straining] Err
178)  GUYBRUSH
Yep, I'm stuck.
179)  GUYBRUSH
It's a detailed map of the entire Gulf of Melange.  This thing'll come in handy if I ever get off this fershlugginer island.
180)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think anything short of explosive force is going to open up that tar barrel.
181)  GUYBRUSH
Now WHY would I want to get that all covered with sticky tar?
182)  GUYBRUSH
Finally, the Rock of Gelato! Now to find Elaine!  Mister Van Winslow!  My spyglass!
183)  WINSLOW
Aye-aye sir!
184)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm, Elaine's ship looks pretty good considering that it was EXPLODING the last time I saw it.
185)  GUYBRUSH
But where's MY ship?  And Elaine?   Is she out looking for me?  Is she still in LeChuck's clutches?  Is her beautiful bloated corpse slowly rotting at the bottom of the-- Hey!
186)  GUYBRUSH
What's that?  Winslow, enhance the upper-right quadrant 50%!
187)  GUYBRUSH
It's my ship!  Winslow, full enhancement!
188)  GUYBRUSH
Elaine!  I'm coming, plunder bunny!  Wait, what's that?
189)  GUYBRUSH
Oh no, it's LeChuck!  Elaine, look out!
190)  GUYBRUSH
[read like “Is that you, plunder bunny?”] Plunder bunny?
191)  MORGAN
Guybrush Threepwood!
192)  MORGAN
I've been waiting a long time for this!
193)  GUYBRUSH
[sheepish] Um, could you wait a little longer?
194)  LECHUCKDEMON
[shouting]{angry} Arrrr, Threepwood!  You've led me a merry chase, but soon the dread mysteries of these ancient simians{devilish} will be mine, and the seas will run red with the blood of my enemies!  Har-har-harrr!
195)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[shouting][stern and commanding] All right LeChuck, put down the monkey and back away from my wife!
196)  LECHUCKDEMON
{default}[slowly chanting some voodoo ritual]Oh-a-ahmi, Oh-a-ahmi...
197)  ELAINE
[loudly, speaking between ships] They're pinned to your mast!{default}
198)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Oh yeah!{default}
199)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}LeChuck!
200)  LECHUCKDEMON
{devilish}Do ya mind?  {angry}I be in the middle of an unholy ceremony here!
201)  GUYBRUSH
{angry}Unholy THIS!
202)  ELAINE
{sarcastic}"Unholy this?"
203)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Yeah, I know, but he didn't give me much to work with{surprised}-HEY!
204)  ELAINE
{surprised}[slightly loudly, over the transformation] Is that how the cutlass is supposed to work?
205)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}[shouting over the sound and light show of LeChuck's transformation] I... don't... know...{scared}it's...so... bright...!
206)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What the heck?
207)  ELAINE
{surprised}[stunned] Woof!
208)  LECHUCK
I... I... I'm human!
209)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}That's debatable...
210)  ELAINE
[shaking off her befuddled entrancement]  {stern}Guybrush, quick!  Finish him off!
211)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What? {default}Oh, right!
212)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}This is for the monkeys, LeChuck!
213)  GUYBRUSH
[stunned] Elaine?
214)  ELAINE
{worried}[stunned] Guybrush?
215)  GUYBRUSH
ELAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaaaanie!!!
216)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[shouting between ships] Prepare to meet your frosty carbonated maker, LeChuck!
217)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} The SCUMM Bar! Haven for the rowdiest bunch of drunken skallywags you'll ever see!
218)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy}Hi there, scruffy-looking pirate-person! {Proud}I'm Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate! What's your name?
219)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous}Wait a minute, your name is I Cheese?
220)  GUYBRUSH
{Proud}How would you like to join my crew of mighty pirates?
221)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Oh c'mon! Join my crew. It'll be fun!
222)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiny} I've got troubles.
223)  GUYBRUSH
I haven't got a crew to take me to Lucre Island.
224)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} On second thought, I hate listening to myself whine.
225)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused}What was it I was supposed to be doing?
226)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} More backrubs and foot massages?
227)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} That is one FAT BIRD!
228)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic}She was a lot nicer before she died.
229)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uh y-yes dear?
230)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried}W-won't that make you a flesh {Scared}eating  zombie?
231)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy}I'm in the market for an enchanted sword that hypnotizes my enemies into a deep {Cocky} stupor before I skewer them with it.
232)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} ID?!? I don't got to show you no stinkin' ID!
233)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} I...uh...left it in my other pants.
234)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} Yeah! Busy makin' holes in the wall.
235)  LECHUCKDEMON
{devilish}[shouting between ships]Arrr!  Come and get me, ya dirt-diggin' doily dipper!
236)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}[shouting]I'm not showboating, I'm--
237)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Whoooah!
238)  GUYBRUSH
Oops.
239)  ELAINE
{sarcastic}[to herself] And now we're going to die.  {bitchy}Again.  Wonderful.{default}
240)  LECHUCKDEMON
[shouting between ships]Har-har-harrrrrr!{default}
241)  ELAINE
{bitchy}Hmmm.
242)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}How'd you do that?
243)  ELAINE
You don't spend several years at the side of {sarcastic}Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™{default} without picking up a FEW tricks, darling.
244)  GUYBRUSH
[despondent] My ship!  {worried}My booty!  {whiney}My collection of autographed sextants!{default}
245)  ELAINE
{surprised}We'll buy you some more sextants later,{angry} just stop LeChuck!{default}
246)  GUYBRUSH
{default}I'd fire the cannon, but Elaine jettisoned all my ammo after I{embarrassed} "accidentally" sank her mother's schooner.
247)  GUYBRUSH
You really should take better care of your plants, Elaine.  This one's roots are bursting right out of its pot.
248)  ELAINE
I've been meaning to get around to it, but as you can see, I've been a bit busy.{default}
249)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Poor little guy... {default}I wonder if it'll have "phantom root" pains now.
250)  GUYBRUSH
{default}I wonder if there's anything useful down there...
251)  GUYBRUSH
Nope.  Nothing but a bunch of lazy crewmen.  {disgust}I can't believe I spent so much time recruiting those guys.{default}
252)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Nope, nothing in there but a decade's worth of fantastic pirate booty.{default}
253)  GUYBRUSH
Hang in there guys!  We'll get you out as soon as I put an end to LeChuck!
254)  GUYBRUSH
It's Elaine's barrel of "lite" grog.  It's like real grog, only without the taste, calories, or debilitating blackouts.
255)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}It's a barrel of lite grog, made incredibly fizzy by my clever application of breath mints.  {suspicious}I'm still not drinking it, though.{default}
256)  GUYBRUSH
It's a barrel of lite grog with a bunch of roots in it... root grog, if you will.
257)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}It's a glowing, fizzy barrel of "root grog."{default}
258)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Ah, the legendary Monkey Casket of Kauai!  {confused}I'll never forget the horrible hula of Hades I had to do to get this thing!{default}
259)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Come to Guybrush, you spooky voodoo recipe you.{default}
260)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Elaine thought I was an idiot for buying the "auto-navigation" option, but who's the idiot now, huh?{default}
261)  GUYBRUSH
{default}That's unnecessary... {happy}those monkeys have surprisingly good breath!{default}
262)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Care for a breath mint?{default}
263)  ELAINE
{bitchy}Oral hygiene can wait, love.{default}
264)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think I can hit her mouth from here.
265)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Hmmm.  Fizzy lo-cal grog.  {default}I bet I can make a fortune selling this to...{confused} well, no one.{default}
266)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Now THAT'S some fizzy root grog.  {disgust}I bet it still tastes like monkey snot, though.{default}
267)  GUYBRUSH
I think that monkey's got enough problems without me complaining about his breath.
268)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Hey LeChuck!
269)  LECHUCKDEMON
{angry}Who dares interrupt my arcane reverie!?
270)  GUYBRUSH
Want a breath mint?
271)  LECHUCKDEMON
Whaaat?
272)  GUYBRUSH
Seriously, the funk that's comin' out of your mouth could peel the blubber off a manatee!{default}
273)  LECHUCKDEMON
Arrrrr!{default}
274)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Let's see if these roots add anything to this horrible not-grog.
275)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Blech.  This "root grog" is bland, joyless, and jejune.  {default}It's also flat.
276)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I don't think this sword can slice open that hold.{default}
277)  GUYBRUSH
Let's see if we can cut back some of those unruly roots.
278)  GUYBRUSH
There, much neater.
279)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think that plant would survive a second trimming.
280)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Brace yourself, I'm gonna cut you free!
281)  ELAINE
{sarcastic}Cut through these ropes with that sword?{surprised}  Are you crazy?
282)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}Crazy in looOOOoove, maybe.{default}
283)  ELAINE
{default}You just worry about LeChuck, sweetheart.{bitchy}  I'll be okay.{default}
284)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I don't think I should be throwing my cutlass at Elaine from way over here.  {scared}I could hit something sensitive.{default}
285)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Hmm, a wet cutlass.  {default}Just what I've always wanted.
286)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Okay, you barrel of disgusting lo-cal goo, make yourself useful!
287)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Boo-yeah!  Look out LeChuck, here comes Guybrush Threepwood's glowing sword of hot monkey vengeance!
288)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}I wondered where all my gunpowder went after the {default}mother-in-law incident.
289)  GUYBRUSH

290)  GUYBRUSH
{default}All right, time to give this cutlass a root beer shower.
291)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Flat root beer?  What kind of second-rate voodoo seltzer bottle has FLAT root beer?{default}
292)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}En garde!
293)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ow!{default}
294)  ELAINE

298)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}Look!   A three-headed monkey!
299)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}Hey!  Keep yer grubby mitts off me bottle breaker!
300)  GUYBRUSH
Yoink!
301)  GUYBRUSH
It's amazing how many of life's problems are solved by indiscriminate cannon fire...
302)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Allez-oop!
303)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Uh-oh.
304)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[muffled] Hey!
305)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Oof!
306)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[struggling against Winslow's cranking] Grrrr... ar!
307)  GUYBRUSH
{angry}[straining] Grrrr!
308)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Oh, monkeyspit.
309)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Man, those are some sturdy undies.
310)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, it looks like this clothesline can be cranked from either side.  Snazzy.
311)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}[as though reading an ad] "Sheer, sexy, and playful, with plenty of support, for the active pirate."
312)  GUYBRUSH
That sock needs a good darning.
313)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Darn you, sock!
314)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Okay, now what?
315)  GUYBRUSH
It's a good thing Winslow's undies have so much crotchal support.
316)  GUYBRUSH
These size 9 bombs won't fit in that size 3 sock.
317)  WINSLOW
{happy}[stifling a laugh sound] <snort!>
318)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Hey, those things are heavy!
319)  WINSLOW
[apologetic while still trying to suppress a laugh] No need to explain, lad.  Happens to the best of us.
320)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Take that!
321)  WINSLOW
{happy}[stifling a laugh sound] I'm sorry, what exactly was I supposed to be taking?
322)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}[annoyed]  Never mind.
323)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[facetiously] No.  Don't.  Please.
324)  WINSLOW
{cocky}You'll have to be a lot sneakier than that if you want to knock ME off, lad!
325)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Oh, I wouldn't say that...
326)  WINSLOW
{confused}What?
327)  WINSLOW
{surprised}Clever boy...
328)  WINSLOW
{happy}Well played, Master Threepwood!  Or should I say "Captain Threepwood?"
329)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Captain?
330)  WINSLOW
{enthused}Aye!  Now that you've bounced me off the Screaming Narwhal, you're officially its captain until someone else comes along and knocks you off!
331)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Sweet!
332)  WINSLOW
Aye, bloody well sweet it is!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some massive internal hemorrhaging to attend to.   Congratulations!
333)  NIPPERKIN
{suspicious}I just got a tip that there's some kind of wanton piracy going on around here!
334)  GUYBRUSH
Not just any wanton piracy! {proud} [proud] A genuine ship seizure, committed by none other than Captain Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™!
335)  NIPPERKIN
{happy}Wonderful!  I can probably get a week's worth of stories out of this!
336)  NIPPERKIN
{stern}You know, Threepwood, you've got spunk. {Sarcastic} Pirate spunk.
337)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}Well, it all started back on Melee Island™...
338)  NIPPERKIN
{sarcastic}Keep up the swashbuckling, Threepwad, and I'll be forking over the secrets of Deep Gut in no time!
339)  GUYBRUSH
What can you tell me about this bottle?
340)  CRIMPDIGIT
{cocky}Arrr, that be one of my special "unbreakable" bottles!
341)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}"Unbreakable?" Ha! {proud}[proud] There isn't a bottle alive that's a match for MY gift for destruction!
342)  CRIMPDIGIT
{default}The secret ingredients are those jagged crystal reefs. {stern} They're tougher than diamonds!
343)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Weird.  But what do you do if you want to open one of these unbreakable bottles in order {embarrassed}to, say, look at an ancient scroll that you've cleverly sealed inside?
344)  CRIMPDIGIT
{cocky}Arrr, that's a good question, lad.  Here, I'll show you how it's done.
345)  CRIMPDIGIT
{enthused}I use this beauty to chip off flakes from the reefs, and to crack open bottles like this one.
346)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So let me get this straight - Your "unbreakable" bottles {happy}are, in fact, opened by breaking them?
347)  GUYBRUSH
Nothing more pirate-y than the ol' "climbing up the anchor" trick...
348)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Oh, dang.
349)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Hot! hot! hot!  Ow!
350)  WINSLOW
You'll have to do better than that, lad!
351)  WINSLOW
{cocky}Ahem.
352)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[Annoyed] And now the dock is smoldering.  Perfect.
353)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I don't know why I keep doing that.

358)  DESINGE
[cheery][filter: through a tube] Bonjour!
359)  MCGEE
[screaming][filter: through a tube]  HEY!  WHAT HAPPENED TO ME OTHER LEG!?
360)  DESINGE
[cheery][filter: through a tube] Hello?
361)  WINSLOW
[in pain][filter: through a tube]Argh, my spleen!
362)  GUYBRUSH
Sounds like he's busy.
363)  GUYBRUSH
I'll just come back later.
364)  GUYBRUSH
I should probably come back after he's done with his patient.
365)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Yeah, I think I'll try again later.
366)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Prepare to be boarded, Van Winslow!
367)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What the-?
368)  WINSLOW
{cocky}Bacon grease, boyo.  Slickest stuff in the seven seas.
369)  GUYBRUSH
{angry}Grrrr...
370)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}[sliding down the gangplank]  Ahhhhhh!
371)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Aw, crud, this jacket was an anniversary present, and now it's all covered with bacon grease!{worried}  Man, is Elaine gonna be p.o.'d.
372)  GUYBRUSH
Let's try that again.
373)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Grrrr...
374)  GUYBRUSH
[sliding backwards on the gangplank]  Ahhhhhh!
375)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Yup, still pointless.
376)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think those embers are going out any time soon.
377)  GUYBRUSH
The Screaming Narwhal may not be particularly pretty (or seaworthy), but at least she's a ship.
378)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}I've got a ship again! {worried} Now if only these stupid winds would stop sucking, I could sail away and find Elaine.
379)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}If I give you a flower, will you allow me to seize the Screaming Narwhal?
380)  WINSLOW
{happy}[amused] By Jove lad, that is by far the silliest attempt to get me off this ship in months!
381)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}So you'll do it?
382)  WINSLOW
Of course not.  YOU may be silly, but I'm not!  Ha!
383)  GUYBRUSH
Would you like a flower?
384)  CRIMPDIGIT
{worried}Nay, those things make me sneeze like a banshee... {default}which can be a real hazard when you're blowing molten glass.
385)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Hmm.  Banshees sneeze.  Who knew?
386)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think those embers are going out any time soon.
387)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Hmm carvings of mermaids... or are they mer-men?
388)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}I don't really have the education, jacket, or fedora to properly interpret ambiguous ancient carvings.
389)  GUYBRUSH
It's locked.
390)  CRIMPDIGIT
Arr, the only people allowed in me studio are me, meself, and I [pronouonced "ayyyye."]
391)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}[angry] Come back later!  We're closed until I can replace all me inventory that SOMEONE blasted to hades and back!
392)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Man, what kind of a jerk would do that?
393)  CRIMPDIGIT
[angry] I don't know, but when I find the scupperscraper, I'll shove one of me bottles so deep up his fundament....
394)  CRIMPDIGIT
[angry] Arrgh!
395)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}What's a "fundament"?
396)  CRIMPDIGIT
[angry] We're closed!
397)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "Well, Blow Me Down Glassworks."
398)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I'm not sure whether this is Late Rococo or Early Creepy.
399)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Mmmm, flowers.
400)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}What a crummy sconce.
401)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}That contraption just screams “mad scientist.” {default} Or at the least, “extremely miffed scientist.”
402)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused}Huh?
403)  GUYBRUSH
I think I've made a big enough impression on this cheese wheel.
404)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Holy screaming starfish!
405)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}I think I've just found my ride off this stinkin' island.
406)  WINSLOW
{stern}[loudly, from above] Not so fast, my well-coiffed friend!
407)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Who?
408)  WINSLOW
[loudly, from the deck] Reginald Van Winslow, captain of the Screaming Narwhal.  {cocky}And you are?
409)  GUYBRUSH
It's a pile of roots from Elaine's plant.
410)  GUYBRUSH
You wouldn't believe the incredible adventures I went through finding all the parts for this thing.
411)  GUYBRUSH
Over the years I've learned the best time to use a weapon is when it's pulsing with spooky voodoo energy.
412)  GUYBRUSH
I kind of guessed that the breath mints would make the root beer fizzy... but I'm a little freaked out by the glowing.
413)  GUYBRUSH
It's a seltzer bottle full of root beer.  It looks kind of flat.
414)  GUYBRUSH
I wonder how you open this thing...
415)  GUYBRUSH
Aha!
416)  GUYBRUSH
A seltzer bottle full of root beer!  I haven't seen one of these since before I had a beard!
417)  GUYBRUSH
What was a seltzer bottle doing in a monkey coffin, anyway?
418)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm.  Looks like I've only got a couple of steps left.
419)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Whoah!  Fizz city!{default}
420)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}If I make this root beer any fizzier, the bottle'll break.{default}
421)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]"Fizzy Phil's Breath Mints - Give Your Mouth the Gift of Fizz."
422)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So doc, what's the verdict?
423)  DESINGE
{happy}Ah, monsieur, you are a very lucky man!
424)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}I am?
425)  DESINGE
Ah oui!  {amazed}The disease spreading through your saucy little pirate hand is like nothing I've ever seen before!
426)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}That doesn't sound very lucky...
427)  DESINGE
In fact, {stern}somewhere in that oozing appendage may lie the secrets{amazed} to life itself!
428)  GUYBRUSH
It may?  {happy}Hey, nice going, hand!
429)  DESINGE
{arrogant}I'll know more after I cut it off.
430)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What?
431)  GUYBRUSH
Hey!
432)  DESINGE
{happy}But of course, Monsieur Threepwood! The only cure for a hand THAT infected is a quick clean amputation!
433)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[trying not to freak out] Amputation!?{scared}  Isn't that a little rash?
434)  DESINGE
{stern}No, it's a very BIG rash, which is why we have to amputate!  {default}But not to worry, monsieur, your hand won't feel a thing thanks to my {happy}specially-concocted grog anesthetic!
435)  GUYBRUSH
Ow!
436)  DESINGE
{default}Now, if you'll just relax here for a few minutes, I'll be in the back sharpening my petite guillotine blade.  {happy}[cheery] We don't want to cut off our hand with a dull blade, now do we?
437)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Well, I guess you have a point there...
438)  DESINGE
Au revoir!{default}
439)  GUYBRUSH
What a loon.  {confused}But at least my hand seems under control for a while.
440)  GUYBRUSH
{default}I'd better figure out a way out of this tastefully appointed abattoir before {suspicious}the Marquis de Crazypants comes back.{default}
441)  GUYBRUSH
{default}It's a cute little guillotine... {worried}that's about to cut my hand off!{default}
442)  GUYBRUSH
I wonder what that does?
443)  DESINGE
{default}THAT is my experimental Foudrovolium, which pulls lightning from the skies via {happy}these cute little voles!
444)  GUYBRUSH
Why would you do that?{default}
445)  DESINGE
SCIENCE!{default}
446)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}It's a machine that uses rodents to make lightning.{default}
447)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I wonder what's in that box?{default}
448)  DESINGE
That's where I keep poor little Jacques.  Now that I've nursed him back to health after his terrible ordeal, I'm training him to help out around my laboratorium.
449)  GUYBRUSH
{default}It's the box for Jacques.{happy}  Hmm, a Jacques-in-the-Box.{default}
450)  GUYBRUSH
{default}It's a key.{suspicious}  I can't reach it from this position.{default}
451)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Feets don't fail me now...
452)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Score one for the pirate with the pointy feet!{default}
453)  GUYBRUSH
It's some sort of foot pedal.  I can't reach it from here.
454)  GUYBRUSH
It's a pedal that releases a banana.  I can't reach it from here.
455)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Let's see what this does.
456)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Bananas from heaven!  Thanks, banana god!{default}
457)  GUYBRUSH
Let's see what this does.
458)  DESINGE
Please don't fiddle with my assistant instruction pedal, mon ami!  It is, how you say, "sensitive."
459)  GUYBRUSH
It's a snazzy bronze foot pedal. I can't reach it.
460)  GUYBRUSH
It's a pedal that causes that machine over there to go crazy.
461)  GUYBRUSH
This looks like it might do something interesting...
462)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}That's the key De Singe used to lock me down!{default}  If only it weren't so far away!
463)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}If I had to guess, I'd say that was one of DeSinge's former patients...{suspicious} probably one who came in with a hangnail.{default}
464)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Murray?{default}
465)  GUYBRUSH
It's a cute little baby bell.  I can't reach it from this position.
466)  GUYBRUSH
It's a cute little bell that makes the monkey play with that picture machine over there.
467)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}What an amazing device.
468)  DESINGE
{happy}Ah, I see you have discovered my incredible Illuminopictoscreen!  {amazed}It harnesses the power of light to amplify tiny drawings a thousandfold!
469)  DESINGE
Just imagine, someday people will be able to share hundreds of pictures of their holiday travels with their extended families, {happy}simultaneously!{default}
470)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}You fiend!{default}
471)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}It's De Singe's Ilumi-,{suspicious}  Illiminu, Imilinu... {default}it's a machine that puts pictures on a wall.
472)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, a stack of pictures.
473)  GUYBRUSH
It's a stack of pictures for that picture-embiggening-device over there.
474)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Those are the stairs I naively climbed to enter this lab of horrors.{default}
475)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}It's a strange drawing of the inside of my hand.
476)  DESINGE
{happy}I call it a "LA DESINGEOGRAPH!"{default}
477)  GUYBRUSH
I call it creepy.{default}
478)  GUYBRUSH
{default}It's a "desingeograph" of the inside of my hand,{surprised} bones and all.{default}
479)  GUYBRUSH
The monkey knocked over that picture of my hand, but I can't reach it from here.
480)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}All right feet, make yourselves useful...
481)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}All right!  A gross picture of my grosser hand!  Things are looking up!{default}
482)  DESINGE
{amazed}Hmmm... very interesting... {confused}and you say your sick little hand has a mind of its own?
483)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Yeah, it keeps hitting people, making rude gestures, {confused}doing all sorts of stuff I'd never do... {suspicious}well, not without a really good reason anyway.
484)  DESINGE
{amazed}Fascinating.
485)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So, can you fix it?
486)  DESINGE
{happy}Monsieur Threepwood, {arrogant}you have my word as a former physician of the Court of King Louis that {amazed}by the time you leave here, your misanthropic hand will never trouble you again!{default}
487)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Go right ahead, doc.
488)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}[watching the tail bob] That's it... {confused}come on, you magnificent magnetic monkey...
489)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Gotcha!  Now to work the [straining to bend his hand backwards]{suspicious} key... into... the lock...
490)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ta-daaaa!
491)  DESINGE
{angry}Monsieur Threepwood!  What do you think you're doing?  {stern}Get back on that table at once!
492)  GUYBRUSH
Sorry, doc, {cocky}but I think I should get a second opinion.  {happy}Thanks for numbing up my hand, though!  {suspicious}All that flailing and slapping was getting on my nerves!
493)  DESINGE
{angry}Wait!{default}
494)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Wow, an electromagnetic monkey!... {happy}I had a dream like that once, {confused}only it was an iguana, not a monkey, and instead of a key{happy} it was an ice cream cone.  {suspicious}Plus, I was in my underwear for some reason...
495)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I hope this works, or I'm about to throw away a perfectly good key...
496)  DESINGE
{stern}Jacques!  Bad monkey!  {angry}After I take care of Monsieur Threepwood, it's back in the box for you!{default}
497)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Listen, monkey, if you and I work together, we can both bust out of this joint.  {suspicious}Whaddaya say, are you with me?
498)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}That's the universal symbol for "yes!"{default}
499)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Ouch.  {suspicious}That looked unpleasant.{default}
500)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Sorry!{default}
501)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Waitasec... {confused}is he enjoying this?{default}
502)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Sick little monkey.{default}
503)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm... lightning and monkeys... what's the connection?
504)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm...
505)  GUYBRUSH
It's a beautiful rendering of the classic "Pirate Da Vinci."
506)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Wow, my hand looks about 80 times more disgusting when it's blown up like this.{default}

{confused}I don't think I can unlock that.{default}
512)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I don't think this key goes with that lock, and besides, I don't think my legs will bend that far.{default}
513)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I've heard of these... {confused}I think they're called "microscopes."
514)  DESINGE
I prefer the term "Enlargorama."

{evil}[going LeChuck] Yeah, and I'd prefer to rip yer gizzard out, ya sniveling sea slug!
516)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}[normal]  Whoah!  What was that?{default}
517)  GUYBRUSH
It's an "Enlargorama."
518)  GUYBRUSH
That's the door to De Singe's balcony, for mad doctoring "al fresco."
519)  GUYBRUSH
{default}De Singe is back there, {worried}sharpening his blades.
520)  DESINGE
Did you say something?
521)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}No, just talking to myself.  {confused}I do that sometimes.
522)  DESINGE
You know, I can cure that too!
523)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}No thanks, I'm good.{default}
524)  DESINGE
As you wish.

{cocky}But I'm a pirate, so I'll just say{stern} "arrrrr."{default}
534)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Within those musty tomes lies the scientific know-how to get me out of this jam.

545)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}How'd a crusty pirate like yourself wind up making little glass unicorns?
548)  GUYBRUSH
What can you tell me about Flotsam Island?
549)  CRIMPDIGIT
Well, ye probably already know about Flotsam's infernal winds, {enthused}but has anyone told you about the reefs?
550)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}The reefs?
551)  CRIMPDIGIT
{default}Aye, the crystal reefs of Flotsam Island!  {enthused}Sharper than a dragon's tooth they be!  They encircle the island, shredding any ship foolish enough to get caught in Flotsam's winds!
552)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Yikes!
553)  GUYBRUSH
Could you use your nifty bottle breaking tool to break open a bottle for me?
554)  CRIMPDIGIT
Of course!
555)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Great-
556)  CRIMPDIGIT
That'll be 37 pieces of eight.
557)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}What?  I haven't got any pieces of eight!
558)  CRIMPDIGIT
{sarcastic}Then I guess I won't be breaking any bottles for you.
559)  GUYBRUSH
If you won't break my bottle, maybe I'll find a bottle breaker of my own!
560)  CRIMPDIGIT
Aye, good luck with that.  This beauty's the only one on the island, so unless you be plannin' to steal it-
561)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Listen matey, glassblowing's every bit a dangerous as Sailing the Spanish Main!  {default}One false move with your glassjack near the glory hole, and you can kiss your eyebrows good-bye!
562)  GUYBRUSH
I can? {suspicious} I'm not sure that's biologically possible.
563)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What's this "Alphabet Sale" all about?
564)  CRIMPDIGIT
{enthused}It's the latest thing!  {happy}I make unbreakable tubes in the shapes of letters, which can be used to created festive illuminated business signs, novelty mementoes or lamps.
565)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Kitschy.
566)  CRIMPDIGIT
Aye, very camp.  {default}Consonants cost 48 pieces of eight, {enthused}but today I'm giving away one free vowel per customer.  Would you like a vowel?
567)  GUYBRUSH
I think I'd like one of those free vowel tubes.
568)  CRIMPDIGIT
{enthused}You'd like to buy a vowel, eh?  Here ya go!
569)  GUYBRUSH
Thanks for chatting, {embarrassed}but I've got a wife and arch-nemesis to return to.
570)  CRIMPDIGIT
Aye, who doesn't?
571)  GUYBRUSH
I'll let you return to your fancy-shmansy glassblowing.
572)  CRIMPDIGIT
Aye, {stern}and I'll let you return to being a pest.
573)  GUYBRUSH
How goes the glassblowing?
574)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Don't get me started!  {angry}[angry] Some idiot just blasted a batch of me best unicorns to kingdom come!
575)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}No!
576)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Aye!  When I get my hands on him I'm gonna {angry}[he goes full-pox here] rip out his tongue and pour molten glass down his throat!  Arrrrrrr! [he snaps out of it.]
577)  GUYBRUSH
How's the glassblowing biz?
578)  CRIMPDIGIT
{sad}Arrr, it be in serious trouble, sonny.  Some thievin' scoundrel stole me one-of-a-kind bottle breaker!
579)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}The devil you say!
580)  CRIMPDIGIT
Without me bottle breaker, I can't break open me unbreakable bottles!  And if can't break them open, who's gonna want to buy them?  I'm ruined!
581)  GUYBRUSH
{default}You could always go back to pirating.
582)  CRIMPDIGIT
{angry}[He goes full-pox][angry]Are you soft in the head?  What kind of blankety-blank pirate would I be without a ship!?  Or Winds!?  Or Eyebrows!? [he snaps out of it]
583)  GUYBRUSH
[saying it without full bravado, kinda by rote, still looking at his hand] {Stern} I'm Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™, {Default}and--
584)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} A pirate, eh?  {Suspicious} Well, I'll believe it when I see it, kid.  {Cocky} Still, it'd be nice to have a real genuine pirate buckling his swash around Flotsam Island again. {Default} Why, I haven't had a honest-to-goodness pirate story to write about {Stern} in over six months!  {Default} Yessireebob, nothing like the promise of a good pirate story to get the ol' {Sarcastic} journalistic juices flowin' again, sez I...
585)  GUYBRUSH
[trying to get a word in edgewise] {Confused} Um...
586)  GUYBRUSH
[trying to get a word in edgewise] {Worried} Er...
587)  GUYBRUSH
[exasperated] {Angry} Hey!
588)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} Say!  {Stern} Just listen to me prattling on, while you stand there {Sarcastic} all wet and confused and whatnot.  {Default} SO, what's {Suspicious} your story, Creepwood?
589)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} This island looks, {Suspicious} ur, lovely, but {Confused} where can I find a ship?  {Stern} I really need to get back to the Rock of Gelato and find my wife!
590)  NIPPERKIN
{Default} Well, there's only one ship here on Flotsam Island, {Sarcastic} but it won't do you any good.
591)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Why not?
592)  NIPPERKIN
{Stern} It's the winds, Threepwand, {Suspicious} the winds!  {Default} Here on Flotsam Island, the winds are always blowing inward, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.  {Confused} It's a freak of nature,{Sarcastic} a fluke, {Suspicious} a curse.  {Default} Whatever you wanna call it, the result is the same - once you've landed on Flotsam Island, {Stern} you're TRAPPED.
593)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Are you seriously telling me there's no way off this island?
594)  NIPPERKIN
{Cocky} Well, not by ship, anyway.  {Default} The only person who I think might know a way off the island is Deep Gut.
595)  GUYBRUSH
[curious] {Confused} Deep Gut?  {Stern} What's a Deep Gut?
596)  NIPPERKIN
{Default} Deep Gut's my secret source for off-island news stories.  {Cocky} And it's a good thing, too!  {Default} Without the Gut's uncanny inter-island scoops, the Keelhauler Gazette would never be able to compete with those [angry] {Angry} snooty prima donnas over at the Flotsam Times!
597)  GUYBRUSH
[curious] {Suspicious} Off-island news?  {Happy} Then he might know something about Elaine! {Stern} Where can I find this "Deep Gut?"
598)  NIPPERKIN
{Sarcastic} Hold on a second, pirate-boy!  {Stern}Davey J. Nipperkin doesn't go handing over his secret sources to every Tom, Dick, and {Suspicious} Guybrush that washes ashore!
599)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} But I can pay you!  With treasure!  {Sarcastic} From my ship...[crestfallen] {Whiny} which is probably at the bottom of the ocean by now.
600)  NIPPERKIN
{Suspicious} Look, kid, you seem like a nice enough pirate, {Default} so I'll make you a deal.
601)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} A deal?
602)  NIPPERKIN
{Cocky} Oh, we used to love all sorts of piracy here on Flotsam! {Happy}  Barely a day would go by without a good bar fight, ship seizing, or buried treasure cropping up!  {Confused} Now it seems like all anyone wants to do is hang around and wait for the winds to change...
603)  GUYBRUSH
[proud] {Proud} Well, leave it to me, and your sleepy little hamlet will be bubbling over with buccaneering boisterousness before you know it!
604)  NIPPERKIN
{Enthused} That's the spirit, kid!  {Default} If you can translate that moxie into newsmaking pirate mayhem, then I'll {Happy}hand you Deep Gut on a silver platter!
605)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} A snap.
606)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} A sna-OW!
607)  VOODOO
[off-screen] Welcome, Guybrush.
608)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}The Voodoo Lady!  Boy, am I glad to see you!  {surprised}I've got so many questions--
609)  VOODOO
{default}There'll be time enough for questions later!  But first, hand me the LeChuck-slayer!
610)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}The what?
611)  VOODOO
The Cursed Cutlass of Kaflu! {mystical}Now that LeChuck has been destroyed, the cutlass must be {stern}ritually dismantled in a soul-chilling voodoo ceremony, to ensure that his evil never reawakens!{default}
612)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Yeahhhh, about that...
613)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}[embarrassed and talking somewhat quickly] I tried to destroy LeChuck with the cutlass, but I had to make some last second substitutions,{embarrassed} and there were some... complications.
614)  VOODOO
{stern}What manner of... complications?
615)  GUYBRUSH
[hemming and hawing] Well, the cutlass didn't so much annihilate LeChuck as it... [quietly] turned him human.
616)  VOODOO
{angry}WHAAAAAAT!?
617)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}I couldn't believe it, either.  {suspicious}[to himself] Personally, I think it's a trick...
618)  VOODOO
[ignoring Guybrush, talking to her self] A human LeChuck... this is... troubling.
619)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Can you help me?
620)  VOODOO
{default}I'll do as much as the fates allow... but I fear that you will not like what I have to say...
621)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Can you help me get off Flotsam Island?  {confused}I've got a ship, but it won't do me any good with these crazy winds.
622)  VOODOO
The cards say... no.
623)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[getting angry] No?  Can't you just {angry}wiggle your fingers and voodoo-shmoodoo the winds to blow out?
624)  VOODOO
What you ask is beyond my power, Guybrush.
625)  GUYBRUSH
{evil}[demonically angry, talking like LeChuck]  Then what in the name of Satan's combover are ya good for,{angry} ya bloated old sea hag!?
626)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Can you tell me if Elaine is okay?
627)  VOODOO
Hmmm, the view is... hazy.  Ask again later.
628)  GUYBRUSH
Later?  But she could be in danger!{worried}  Or dead!  {surprised}Or worse!
629)  VOODOO
I only know what the spirits reveal, Guybrush Threepwood.
630)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Have you got anything for my hand?  {whiney}I think I may have picked up a rash somewhere.
631)  VOODOO
Fascinating.
632)  GUYBRUSH
And itchy.  Can you fix it?
633)  VOODOO
No.
634)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[shaking it off, reverting to normal] [tongue radpidly wags back and forth in mouth as he shakes]Whoo.  {surprised}What was that?
635)  VOODOO
{surprised}That... was the Pox of LeChuck!
636)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Who the whatnow?
637)  VOODOO
{default}The Pox of LeChuck.  When your improperly-enchanted cutlass turned LeChuck into a human, all the evil voodoo juju within him had to go somewhere.  Were you touching him at the time?
638)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Do you have a cure?
639)  VOODOO
No.  But I know where you can find one.
640)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}I feel a pirate-y quest coming on...
641)  VOODOO
{default}To eliminate the Pox of LeChuck, you must seek out... {mystical}LA ESPONJA GRANDE!
642)  GUYBRUSH
[translating] The.. Big... Sponge?
643)  VOODOO
La Esponja Grande is no ordinary sponge, Threepwood.  It is a legendary sea sponge with incredible voodoo exfoliating abilities, capable of absorbing limitless quantities of voodoo mojo.
644)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I'll get right on it after I find Elaine.
645)  VOODOO
{stern}That would be unwise, Guybrush.  {angry}The Pox of LeChuck must be eliminated before it spreads.{default}
646)  GUYBRUSH
Whatever.
647)  VOODOO
I'm afraid the winds of Flotsam are controlled by forces beyond my control, Guybrush.  Perhaps someone in town can help you.
648)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Do you have anything to stave off the Pox of LeChuck? {whiney} This hand is really starting to annoy me.
649)  VOODOO
The ONLY way to safely deal with the Pox is La Esponja Grande.
650)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Why didn't you tell me that grog could be used to stave off the effects of the Pox?
651)  VOODOO
{angry}Grog!?  Grog won't cure the Pox of LeChuck, it'll only make it worse!
652)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}How can grog make ANYTHING worse?
653)  VOODOO
{default}You hand may seem fine now, but when it wakes up, {stern}it'll be even nastier than ever.{default}
654)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}You've just got a thing against grog.
655)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What else can you tell me about the Pox of LeChuck?
656)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Are you sure you can't help me get off Flotsam Island?
657)  VOODOO
As I said, the mysteries of Flotsam are above my pay grade.  Seek out others to assist you.
658)  VOODOO
{stern}It's a creeping cloud of unstoppable evil, spreading LeChuck's accumulated vileness like a disease across the seas!
659)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Ugh!
660)  VOODOO
{default}Even now, I can sense the Pox wending its way to this very island!
661)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}The Pox of LeChuck is spreading!  {surprised}There's a big green cloud of it floating over Flotsam Island!
662)  VOODOO
{default}Then it is even more imperative that you find La Esponja Grande as soon as possible, before LeChuck's residual evil infects pirates everywhere!
663)  GUYBRUSH
No problem.  {cocky}Once I find Elaine I'm all over this Sponge thing.
664)  VOODOO
{stern}Don't allow your concern for Elaine cloud your judgment, young Threepwood.{default}
665)  GUYBRUSH
Listen, {stern}if it comes down to a choice between saving my wife and going on a dangerous pirate quest for a giant magical loofah,{cocky} Elaine's gonna win out at LEAST sixty percent of the time!
666)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Anything else you think I should know about this Pox?
667)  VOODOO
{stern}Only that it must be stopped, {default}and that you are the only one who can stop it.
668)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Do you know anything about the Marquis De Singe?
669)  VOODOO
{default}I do not trust that man, nor do I understand him.
670)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}He tried to cut off my hand!
671)  VOODOO
This does not surprise me.  {stern}"Scientists" such as De Singe would shatter the soul of the world to answer a few petty riddles.  {angry}The fates alone know what he's done to this poor island.{default}
672)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}Do you think De Singe could have something to do with the freaky winds of Flotsam Island?
673)  VOODOO
It would not surprise me, but I cannot tell.
674)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}I've found evidence that De Singe has been manipulating the winds of Flotsam Island!
675)  VOODOO
{default}Then you must work to restore them.  {stern}Ill winds such as these are not natural, and must be returned to their proper balance.{default}
676)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}That's what Elaine always says on taco night.
677)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Assuming that I DO go looking for [air quotes] "La Esponja Grande" after I get off this island, what else can you tell me about it?
678)  VOODOO
{mystical}It's a giant magical sea sponge, capable of absorbing immense voodoo energies.  {default}If there's anything that can mop up all of LeChuck's evil mojo,{mystical} it's the sponge.{default}
679)  GUYBRUSH
Frozen chicken gizzard, frozen newt eyes, snake venom popsicles...
680)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I'm not sure what kind of skull that is, but I hope I never run into one.{default}
681)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Cool bocce ball!
682)  VOODOO
{angry}This is no bocce ball!  {default}This is the Legendary All-Seeing Eye of Yemalla!
683)  GUYBRUSH
All-seeing?  Can it see Elaine's ship, {confused}or what happened to my favorite pair of socks?{default}
684)  VOODOO
Not right now.  It's, um, sleeping.
685)  GUYBRUSH
It's the Voodoo Lady's Legendary Paperweight of Yemalla.
686)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[straining to open chest] Umph!  {default}It's locked.
687)  VOODOO
{mystical}Yes, and it will remain locked until it's ready to reveal its secrets... many moons from now.{default}
688)  GUYBRUSH
It's a mysterious chest that I won't be opening in this episode.
689)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}[enthusiastic] Cards, neat!  {cocky}Anyone up for a quick game of Five Card Draw-and-Quarter?  Follow the Monkey?  {happy}Melee Hold 'Em?
690)  VOODOO
{stern}These cards are not playthings, Guybrush Threepwood!  {default}They are only to be used to divine the will of the Fates!
691)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So, what do the Fates have in store for me?
692)  VOODOO
{mystical}You are about to take a journey...
693)  VOODOO
...on a ship...
694)  VOODOO
...you will suffer a great loss...
695)  VOODOO
...and make a new friend...{Default}
696)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[sarcastic] Ooh, portentous.  Not to mention vague.{default}
697)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Any new tidings from the cards?{default}
698)  VOODOO
{mystical}Not until you begin your journey.{default}
699)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Hey, I bet one of these creepy voodoo books could come in handy.
700)  VOODOO
{default}This is not a lending library, Threepwood.  {stern}Merely intoning the TITLES of these forbidden tomes can inflict a curse on uninitiated tongues!{default}
701)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[sarcastic] Shyeah, right.{default}
702)  GUYBRUSH
[reading]"Chicken Hearts for the Soul."
703)  GUYBRUSH

707)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Spiffy rug.  {confused}Is that some sort of voodoo foursquare court?
708)  VOODOO
{default}That is the symbol of the Crossroads, the intersection between this world and the world of the spirits.  All those who practice the voodoo must make offerings to the Crossroads to draw magic into the world of the living.
709)  GUYBRUSH
Really?  'Cause I've never seen LeChuck offer up anything to anyone.
710)  VOODOO
That is because LeChuck is a selfish abomination, {stern}hoarding voodoo power for personal gain without concern for the natural order of things.  {default}Now that he's human, his leftover plundered mojo is oozing around like a disease, clogging the Crossroads with its putrescence.
711)  GUYBRUSH
It's a rug with a symbol of the Crossroads on it.
712)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Hideous.{default}
713)  GUYBRUSH
{default}[talking to parrot] Knock-knock?
714)  VOODOO
{surprised}Guybrush, don't--
715)  PARROT
<squawak!> Who's there?
716)  VOODOO
[alramed] No-
717)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}It's me, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate!
718)  PARROT
<squawk> [in perfect Guybrush voice] It's me, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate!
719)  VOODOO
{angry}You fool!
720)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What?
721)  VOODOO
I've spent months crafting a Pyrite Parrot of Petaluma, and you've ruined it before it was finished!  Now I'll have to start all over!{default}
722)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Sorry.{default}
723)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Hey, if you're done with this,{happy} can I have it?
724)  VOODOO
{stern}[annoyed] Fine.  It's of no use to me now.{default}
725)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}[addressing the parrot] Who's the studliest pirate in the whole wide world?
726)  GUYBRUSH
Heh.{default}
727)  GUYBRUSH
That really puts the "die" in "diorama."
728)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Yummy.{default}
729)  GUYBRUSH
Can't you use all the magical gunk in these bottles to cure my hand?
730)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I wonder what's in-
731)  VOODOO
{stern}Don't touch that!  It's where I keep my... {mystical}unmentionables.{default}
732)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}[shuddering] Gewghh...{default}
733)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What's this?{default}

738)  MEMBER1
Look out for his hand!
739)  MEMBER2
Ieee!
740)  GUYBRUSH
Sorry!  Ow!
741)  MEMBER1
Oof!

The Pox of LeChuck can only be cured with La Esponja Grande.

I think the Voodoo Lady would get pretty honked off if I broke her crystal ball.
747)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I'm not letting the scorpion loose...{scared} that thing looks dangerous!{default}
748)  GUYBRUSH
What do you make of this?
749)  VOODOO
{mystical}Hmmm, this appears to be an artifact of the Vaycaylians, an ancient tribe that lived here many ages ago.{default}
750)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Would you like a flower?
751)  VOODOO
{default}Hmm, a rare Vacaylian Daisy.
752)  VOODOO
{mystical}They can be used to converse with certain sea creatures.
753)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}What do they talk about?{default}
754)  VOODOO
{default}Fish, mostly.
755)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Would you like another flower?{default}
756)  VOODOO
No thank you.
757)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}I broke open the bottle... can you help me with this scroll?
758)  VOODOO
{stern}[looks at map]  Hmmm.  The Fates have decreed that you must travel this path on your own, Guybrush Threepwood.
759)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}You can't figure it out either, can you?{default}
760)  VOODOO
{default}No, it's the, um, Fates.
761)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}I figured the Vaycaylian scroll out all by myself!{default}
762)  VOODOO
{mystical}All is as the Fates have foresaw.  Foreseen.  {default}Foresook.  Whatever.
763)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Tell me more about this locket.
764)  VOODOO
{default}It was a given to me by my... {mystical}friend.. Coronado De Cava.
765)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Why do you keep putting dramatic pauses around "friend?"  Was Coronado-?
766)  VOODOO
Yes, he was my boyfriend.
767)  GUYBRUSH
{disgust}Icky!
768)  VOODOO
We met in the Jerkbait Islands many years ago.  I fell in love with his treasure hunting mind and his beautiful eyes.  He fell in love with my voodoo charms and my supple-
769)  GUYBRUSH
La-la-la-la!  Not listening!
770)  VOODOO
{surprised}[finishing her torrid description] - like a volcano!  {default}But after several months of ocean-steaming passion, our love cooled after he became obsessed with the myth of La Esponja Grande. When we parted, he gave me that locket...
771)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}Sad... {confused}and disquietingly graphic.{default}
772)  GUYBRUSH
Tell me some more about the locket.
773)  VOODOO
No, it... hurts too much.  Go to the Jerkbait Islands.  Find Coronado De Cava and show him the locket.  If anyone can find La Esponja, he can.
774)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I think this fell off your roof.
775)  VOODOO
{mystical}Ah, I found that when I was building my Shack.  I believe it's an ancient Vaycaylian weather vane.  You can tell by the extra directions, pointing to some of their many wind gods.
776)  GUYBRUSH
Want it back?{default}
777)  VOODOO
{default}No.  The Spirits have obviously delivered it to you for a reason.
778)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I'm feeling kinda bad about your parrot.  {happy}Would you like it back?
779)  VOODOO
{default}No, Guybrush.  {stern}The Curse of the Pyrite Parrot is yours forevermore.{default}
780)  GUYBRUSH
Thanks.  {suspicious}Wait, what?{default}
781)  MCGEE
Arrr!
782)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey there-
783)  MCGEE
{Stern} You!
784)  GUYBRUSH
[confused] {Confused} Me?
785)  MCGEE
{Stern} Couldn't leave an old Hemlock alone with his grog and his tattered dreams, could ya?
786)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Why aren't you in Club 41, curled up with your grog?
787)  MCGEE
[angry][going full pox] {Evil} Because the two-timin' cannon-cloggers kicked me out!
788)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What the heck happened to your legs!?
789)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Why?
790)  MCGEE
{Stern} The Club has a strict "No Feet, No Service" clause.

{Cocky} Talk about adding insult to injury.
792)  MCGEE
[koffing a bit throught]{Stern} You mean ASIDE from some idiot getting a {Sad} poor old pirate involved in a deadly bar fight?
793)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Um, {Happy} yeah.
794)  MCGEE
{Suspicious} Four words - The. Marquis. De. {Stern} Singe.
795)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} The Marquis De Singe cut off your legs?
796)  MCGEE
{Sad} Aye.  Not all at once, of course. {Default}  He cut off the first leg seven years ago, after I {Stern} stubbed me toe while investigating the winds of Flotsam Island.
797)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} That seems kind of severe.
798)  MCGEE
{Sad} Aye.  Sometimes I think that {Stern} poncy git has it {Concerned} in for me.
799)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} YOU were investigating the winds of Flotsam Island?
800)  MCGEE
{Default} Aye.  I've been trying to {Confused} suss out these zany zephyrs since I {Stern} washed up here! {Suspicious} I even found an ANCIENT SCROLL that promised to {Enthused} lead me to all the answers!
801)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} Harsh.
802)  MCGEE
{Concerned} Without two good legs, {Sad} I couldn't explore anymore, {Stern} so I limped into Club 41 and started up a {Sarcastic} long-term relationship with a keg of grog.
803)  GUYBRUSH
{Seductive} Can I see your ancient scroll?
804)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} 'Fraid not, skippy.  {Evil} [angry]Some two-bit witch stole it from me in a poker game a few months ago.  {Stern} [bitter]Won't do her any good without my {Cocky} Eye of the Manatee, though!  Heh!
805)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I was thinking I could carry on your work, to make amends for the whole {Worried}  "getting your leg hacked off" thing.
806)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} If De Singe DOES have it in for you, I might be able to use it wreak some sort of {Cocky} pirate-y revenge on him.
807)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Because I'm a fearsome pirate, and you should do as I say!  {Stern} Arrrr!
808)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Because of my plus-10 charisma?
809)  MCGEE
{Stern} Ehh... fine.  [dejected]{Sad} I can't use it anymore, anyhow.
810)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I got your scroll, but {Worried} I'm having a hard time figuring it out.
811)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} It's a stumper, ain't it?
812)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Got any advice?
813)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} Try not to stub your toe.  Heh.
814)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I figured out your scroll!
815)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} Well, whoopee for you!  {Stern} What did you find?
816)  GUYBRUSH
A big statue that looks like someone playing a musical salamander.
817)  MCGEE
{Suspicious} That must be what those {Stern} danged mer-folk used to controls the winds!
818)  GUYBRUSH
[Confused]{Confused} You mentioned Mer-Folk??
819)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} Aye, Mer-Folk!  Before {Stern} De Singe cut off me leg, I'd discovered that {Suspicious} Flotsam Island was colonized by a <koff!> hidden race of mer-folk called the "Vaycaylians," {Default} who'd grown tired of living under the sea, and wanted to try living on land for a while.
820)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} And?
821)  MCGEE
{Default} It didn't take.  After a {Confused} few hundred years, they went {Suspicious} back to the oceans.  {Stern} Buncha flibbertijibbets, if you ask me.
822)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Anything else you can tell me about those indecisive MerFolk?
823)  MCGEE
{Confused} The Vaycaylians?  {Default} Well, they had a thousand different words for "wind," {Suspicious} but none for "man" or "woman."
824)  GUYBRUSH
{Seductive} Exotic.
825)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Y'know, even aside from the legs, {Sarcastic} you're looking a little green at the gills.
826)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}Um, good luck with that.
827)  MCGEE
[going full pox][angry] {Evil} And I think you should mind yer own beeswax, ya lily-livered chum {Stern} sucker![he recovers]
828)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Whoah.  {Confused} What was that?
829)  MCGEE
{Confused} What was what?
830)  VOODOO
{default}I have never seen it myself, but a former... {mystical}friend... of mine, Coronado De Cava, spent many years searching for it.  {default}I last saw him in the Jerkbait Islands.  Take this locket to him, and tell him I vouched for your character.
831)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So, how'd a dazzling urbanite like yourself wind up in {suspicious}a sleepy pirate island like Flotsam?
832)  DESINGE
{happy}[wistfully remembering]  Ah, mon ami, that is a tale of triumph {stern}and tragedy.  {default}Many years ago, I was a young physician in the court of King Louis.  {happy}Those were heady days, tending to the many ills of the aristocracy, navigating scandalous palace intrigues... {default}I was a rising star in the scientific firmament.
833)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}And zen- {suspicious}I mean -then?
834)  DESINGE
{angry}[fuming] A conspiracy of jealous scientists accused me of performing inhumane cross-breeding experiments with the Queen's poodles!
835)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Scientists can be so catty.
836)  DESINGE
{default}The King was outraged, {stern}and ordered me exiled on this deserted tropical island.
837)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Deserted?  Then you were the first-
838)  DESINGE
{happy}Oui.  Happily, my solitude was short-lived, {default}as the merry winds of Flotsam have conspired to bring me many new pirate patients over the years!
839)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Y'know, Hemlock thinks you've got it in for him.
840)  DESINGE
{stern}Hemlock?
841)  GUYBRUSH
Pirate explorer?  {confused}Two peg legs?  Bit of an attitude?
842)  DESINGE
{default}Ah Hemlock!  Such a sad little pirate.  All those years of searching in vain for the "secrets" of Flotsam Island have driven him, how you say, "cuckoo bananas," no?
843)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Scientifically speaking, {confused}what do YOU think is the cause of these crazy winds swirling around Flotsam.
844)  DESINGE
{default}Ah yes, the winds.  {stern}Personally, I'm convinced that they're a rare, but perfectly natural meteorological phenomenon {default}caused by a LaGrange inversion of the atmospheric humors in the upper troposphere, causing a counter-cyclonic-
845)  GUYBRUSH
Ack!  {disgust}Forget I asked.
846)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} The SCUMM Bar! Haven for the rowdiest bunch of drunken skallywags you'll ever see!
847)  GUYBRUSH
{default}A friend of mine says that my hand is{surprised} cursed with a voodoo pox that can only be cleared up with a magical sponge.
848)  DESINGE
{happy}Voodoo, pfah!  {angry}Voodoo is nothing but unenlightened baby jabber for the ignorant and superstitious masses!  {stern}The only path to true knowledge is via a rigorous scientific inquiry... {default}preferably conducted by a suitably aristocratic mind.
849)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So my pox-
850)  DESINGE
Is nothing more than a disease.  A disease we will cure with{happy} SCIENCE!{default}
851)  DESINGE
{amazed}[excited] Encroyable!

853)  DORO
[Out of breath from all the walking] Whew!  I better start digging...
854)  DORO
{Confused} I hope it's not as deep as the other ones....
855)  DORO
{Stern} Ow!  I got dirt in my eye!
856)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} See, I told you I could find it!
857)  DORO
[whispered] {Stern} Madre de dios!  {Sarcastic} Dark. {Happy} Ninja. {Enthused} Dave. with KillerKarateKatana!!!
858)  DORO

859)  NIPPERKIN
{Suspicious} Do my ears deceive me, or did that portly pirate just dig up a buried treasure?
860)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} He sure did... with a {Proud} little help from Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™!
861)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} That's fantastic!  We haven't had a good "buried treasure" story in weeks!
862)  NIPPERKIN
{Default}I'd better catch up with that wheezy pirate before he {Sarcastic} has a coronary, or worse, {Stern} starts talking to those boobs from {Angry} the Times.
863)  NIPPERKIN
{Sarcastic} Snappy pirating, Threepwood.  {Happy} Keep this up, and the secrets of Deep Gut'll be all yours!
864)  DORO
Don't touch those!
865)  GUYBRUSH
Why?
866)  DORO
They're mine!
867)  GUYBRUSH
Can I have one of your Pink Pajamas Pierres?
868)  DORO
NO!
869)  GUYBRUSH
But I though you didn't like them!
870)  DORO
That doesn't mean I don't WANT them!
871)  GUYBRUSH
[whispering to himself][quickly girding himself to deal with the porcelain]  {Worried} Okay Guybrush... {Stern} it's only a little porcelain... {Default} just close your eyes and {Confused} go to your happy place...
872)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} [mildly disgusted] Ewwww.
873)  DORO
{Stern} I didn't see anything!
874)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} Sorry, must've been a leaf.
875)  DORO
{default} All this turning around {Worried} is getting me winded.
876)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Oh shoot, {Sarcastic} you just missed it.
877)  DORO
{Suspicious} Are you messing with me?
878)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Moi?
879)  GUYBRUSH
I better put this cheese back in my pants before a wandering capybara gobbles it up.
880)  ELAINE
{angry}[shouting between ships]Stop showboating and spray the sword, Guybrush
881)  DESINGE
[muffled by being stuck in the idol] What's happening?
882)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Shh!
883)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} [enthusiastic] All right!!!
884)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} [sheepish] Ooh, the Pox is blowing out to sea!  Hope that doesn't come back to bite me in the fundament.  {Sarcastic} Well, I'm sure it'll be fine.
885)  DESINGE
[stunned] {Amazed} Zut... alors...the winds...
886)  DESINGE
[fuming] {Angry} Do you have any idea what you've done!?  Without the winds of Flotsam bringing me a steady supply of injury-prone pirate test subjects, {Stern} the pace of my groundbreaking experiments will slow to a crawl!
887)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Talk to the hand, sicko, 'cause the pirate ain't listenin'!
888)  DESINGE
[angry] {Angry} Grrrrr!  Mark my words, Threepwood... you'll rue the day you crossed the Marquis De Singe!
889)  DESINGE
{Stern} And your little hand, too!
890)  GUYBRUSH
[shouting after him]  {Confused} Rue!?  I don't know {Stern} the meaning of the word!
891)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Well, looks like my work here is done.  {Happy} I better hurry back to the Screaming Narwhal before the Flotsamites get wind of the, {Confused} um, wind...
892)  DESINGE
What was that fooping sound?
893)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Beats me.  {Default} Now, if you'll just stop waving that rifle around, I've got some winds to change.
894)  DESINGE
Not so fast, insignificant pirate person!
895)  DESINGE
Sacre merde!
896)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Hmm, guess I didn't do whatever I was supposed to do.
897)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Nothin'.
898)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I wonder what I'm doing wrong?
899)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Randomly spinning these dials is getting me nowhere.
900)  DORO
Hey!
901)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Hmmm, that must've been the God of Winds that Knock off Your Hat.
902)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm, I wonder what wind god that was supposed to--
903)  GUYBRUSH
[disgusted]Ewww.  Broken wind, got it.
904)  DORO
Santa Maria Conchita Alonso!  I KNEW I should've worn my chinos today!

Ah, that must be the Wind that Makes you Reconsider Wearing Shorts.

Cease your ham-fisted fumblings, and surrender that hand!
908)  GUYBRUSH

[falling]Ahhhhh!
910)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey, I'm still alive!
911)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Whatta grouch.
912)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} It's a good thing De Singe's rifle is just as wimpy as the man who built it.
913)  DESINGE
Threepwood!
914)  DESINGE
Step away from that delicate machinery, and give me your hand!
915)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} And if I don't?
916)  DESINGE
Threepwood!
917)  DESINGE
You're meddling in affairs you can't possibly understand!
918)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} So what else is new?
919)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious} Hmm, no sign of the Marquis.  {Happy} Good... all that {Confused} shooting was giving me a headache.

[annoyed] {Suspicious} Aw geez.
923)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} How'd you beat me here, anyway?
924)  DESINGE
[arrogant] {Sarcastic} Once I heard the third change in the winds, it was child's play for a {Arrogant} scientifically-trained intellect of my stature to deduce which of the four winds remained.
925)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} So, now what?
926)  DESINGE
[annoyed] {Stern} NOW, my annoying pirate friend, you hand over that ancient leverometer device, I restore the winds to their full "sucking" force, and you accompany me to my laboratorium, so that I can properly remove and study your hand with the pointy sticks of SCIENCE!
927)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} "Leverometer?"
928)  DESINGE
{Angry} [angry] The thing with the seahorse on it!
929)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Oh.  {Sarcastic} Yeah, I don't think I'll be giving you that.

{Confused} Are we already up to fourteen?
936)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Sacre bleu!  It's King Louis the Fifteenth!
937)  DESINGE
{Stern} Now THAT doesn't sound right at all...

{Arrogant} But of course.
943)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Let's try this again.
944)  DESINGE
{Sarcastic} Oui, Let's.
945)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} You know I'm never going to give you my hand, right?
946)  DESINGE
{Sarcastic} Then I suppose I'll just have to improvise a NEW experiment!
947)  VOODOO
[voice altered, as though perhaps trying to sound more masculine]  What's the word?
948)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I've been reliably informed that the bird is, {Sarcastic} in fact, the word.

957)  GUYBRUSH
[straining] {Angry} Grrrrr...
958)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Nope.
959)  GUYBRUSH
{Angry} [straining] Grrrrr...
960)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Nothin'.  And I'm starting to get cuts on my hands.  What's this thing made of anyway?
961)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Wow.  I bet this thing would be really impressive if {Confused} I knew what the heck all these inscriptions meant.
962)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Hmm, I wonder if I can see anything on the other side?
963)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} There's something interesting in there, but I can't tell what it is.
964)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Hmm.  Guess this thing fell off the roof when I had my little "LeChuck Episode."
965)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I should get shouty more often.

Arr, the evil of LeChuck is always evolving in new and terrifying ways, Sheepgood.

1038)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} I almost certain I'm going to regret asking this, but {Sarcastic} WHAT is the rarest of all pirate treasures?
1039)  DORO
{Enthused} Porcelain {Cocky} Power Pirates!
1040)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What in the name of Davey Jones' Closet Organizer are {Sarcastic} Porcelain Power Pirates?
1041)  DORO
{Sarcastic} They're the rarest and {Enthused} coolest action figures ever!  I've been {Stern} tracking them with the Porcelain Power Pirate treasure maps hidden in {Cocky} special boxes of Porcelain Power Pirate Pear-PFlavored [prounounced "Puh-Flavored"] breakfast cereal! {Worried}  I've spent YEARS tracking them down, {Happy} and I've almost got the full set!
1042)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} What were you doing down there?
1043)  DORO
[guiltily] {Worried} Nothin'.
1044)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} It LOOKED like you were playing with dolls.
1045)  DORO
{Stern} They're not dolls!  {Cocky} They're poly-articulated Porcelain Power Pirates!
1046)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} How many P-P Pirates do you have left?
1047)  DORO
{Default} The only Power Pirate I haven't found is the {Sarcastic} ultra-rare, impossible-to-find, {Worried} Dark Ninja Dave with {Surprised} Killer Karate Katana.  {Default} I thought I might find it here on Flotsam Island, {Worried} but I got scammed.
1048)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Scammed?
1049)  DORO
Yeah.  Some {Angry} guy in a plaid jacket with waving arms sold me a Ninja Dave {Stern} map, but it just keeps sending me in circles.
1050)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Mind if I take a look at that map?
1051)  DORO
{Default} Take it.  It's useless.
1052)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} I'll let you know if I find anything.  {Suspicious} You're sure this "Dark Ninja Dave" is a valuable treasure, right?
1053)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Hey look, a three-headed monkey!
1054)  DORO
{Stern} I've already GOT a three-headed monkey figure.
1055)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Look, it's a Ninja Dave figure with Throwing Star Action!
1056)  DORO
{Suspicious} Where?
1057)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Did the winds shipwreck you on Flotsam Island too?
1058)  DORO
{Default} Yes, but I came here voluntarily in search of the {Suspicious} elusive Dark Ninja Dave Porcelain Power Pirate action figure!
1059)  DORO
{Happy} It's the stuff that dreams are made of!  {Enthused} Porcelain dreams!
1060)  GUYBRUSH
{Disgust} What's that big pink pile of dolls-
1061)  DORO
{Cocky} "Action figurines"
1062)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's that big pink pile {Sarcastic} of [air quotes]"action figurines" over there all about?
1063)  DORO
{Sarcastic} Those are my extra Pink Pajama Pierres, {Suspicious} the lamest and  least valuable of the Porcelain Power Pirates. {Stern} I loathe Pink Pajama Pierre with the {Angry} white-hot intensity of a million exploding cannonballs.
1064)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Well, I've got pirate news to make, and you've got {Sarcastic} dolls to play with, so I'll just be on my way.
1065)  DORO
{Stern} They're NOT dolls!
1066)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Bye.

{Stern} Kep'lah!
1068)  BARTENDER
Arr, what'll it be, laddie?
1069)  GUYBRUSH
I've heard you make a mean grogatini.

Meaner than Poseidon's wrath, and sweeter than a siren's song!  I'll set you up.
1071)  BARTENDER
There you are, mate!  One Club 41 Grogatini, on the house!
1072)  GUYBRUSH
You put one of those miniature swords with an olive in my grogatini!  I HATE those things!
1073)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Where does a pirate go to start a bar fight on this island?
1074)  NIPPERKIN
{Default} Well, the only bar around here is Club 41, {Sarcastic} but good luck starting a fight in that joint.  {Stern} They run a pretty tight ship over there. {Suspicious} You know what I mean?
1075)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Where should I look for treasure on this island?
1076)  NIPPERKIN
{Cocky} There used to be all kinds of buried treasures in Flotsam's jungles, {Default} but they've been pretty much tapped out.  If I were you,{Suspicious} I'd look for an established pirate treasure hunter to give you a hand.
1077)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} What kind of ships are there to seize on Flotsam Island?
1078)  NIPPERKIN
{Default} We've only got one ship on Flotsam... {Sarcastic} the Screaming Narwhal.  {Cocky} It hasn't been seized in years!
1079)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What's this [air quotes]"Deep Gut" person like, anyway?
1080)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}[loudly, talking up to the deck] Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™!
1081)  WINSLOW
{sarcastic}[skeptical][loudly] Oh really?  What can I do for you, Mister Mighty Pirate?
1082)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}[getting Van Winslow's attention] Ahoy there!
1083)  WINSLOW
[loudly] Ahoy there, Master Threepwood!
1084)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[loudly]Heave to and strike your colors!  I've come to seize your ship!
1085)  WINSLOW
{confused}[loudly]You have!?  {happy}Jolly good!  No one's been man enough to take the Screaming Narwhal for over two years!
1086)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[too himself]  Hmm, he's got a really good attitude for someone who's about to lose his ship.
1087)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[loudly]Why are you so happy about me seizing your ship?
1088)  WINSLOW
{happy}[loudly]I like a good challenge!  Girds the mind and sharpens the loins, don't you know!
1089)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[loudly]Do you know anything about Club 41?
1090)  WINSLOW
{confused}[loudly]Club 41?  {happy}Wonderful place!  I haven't been there since I lost my Membership Card when I seized the Narwhal!
1091)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly] I found your membership card!
1092)  WINSLOW
{happy}[loudly] Keep it!  In my book, possession is seven-twelfths of the law!
1093)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[loudly] Nice ship!  Were you drunk when you built it?
1094)  WINSLOW
{happy}[loudly] Har-har-har!  Good one, boyo!  But I didn't build the Screaming Narwhal!  It was assembled by a committee of concerned Flotsam citizens!
1095)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly]  Were THEY drunk?
1096)  WINSLOW
{enthused}[loudly]  No, but they had to use whatever floated ashore!  Hence the aforementioned "constructed by sots" look!
1097)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[loudly] If you didn't build the Narwhal, why are you the "captain?"
1098)  WINSLOW
[loudly] By tradition, whoever knocks the captain of the Screaming Narwhal off the deck{enthused} gets to be the captain until HE'S knocked off by the next guy.
1099)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly] How'd you end up on Flotsam?
1100)  WINSLOW
[loudly]Same as everyone else here, lad!  {happy}The winds!  {stern}I was chasing some brigand that had stolen my hard-earned booty, {surprised}when all of the sudden Flotsam's capricious winds picked up my ship, shredded it to bits, {default}and plunked me down on her bounteous shores!
1101)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly] Be seeing you!

1110)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Doc?
1111)  DESINGE
{stern}[cold] Oh, it's YOU.  Unless you're here to volunteer your hand to the advancement of science, I have nothing to say to you.  [to himself, sinisterly] For now.
1112)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}My hand's not dead!{worried}  It moves!  {scared}Sometimes all by itself!
1113)  DESINGE
{amazed}And that's what makes it SO fascinating!  A seemingly necrotic, hand, persistently animating as though compelled by an outside force!  Just imagine the possibilities!
1114)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Why are you so interested in my hand, anyway?
1115)  DESINGE
{stern}Because the disease that courses through it appears{amazed} to be an entirely new life form, capable of animating and taking over dead tissues!
1116)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}[enthused] No kidding?  That's so {worried}- wait, did you say "dead" tissues?
1117)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What are you doing out here?  Don't you have some mildly-injured pirates to mangle?
1118)  DESINGE
I'm investigating these wondously icky green clouds that have settled over Flotsam Island.
1119)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Are you SURE you don't know anything about Flotsam's winds?
1120)  DESINGE
{stern}What are you insinuating?
1121)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}It occurs to me that the weird winds around here have been pretty good to you... {suspicious}giving you a steady supply of "patients" and all.
1122)  DESINGE
{Stern}I have no idea what you're talking about.
1123)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}C'mon, confess... YOU'RE the guy behind all these freaky winds, aren't you?
1124)  DESINGE
{angry}[angry] What an outrageous accusation!  Do you have any proof?
1125)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Uhh-
1126)  DESINGE
{stern}[angry]  I thought not.  Good day sir!
1127)  GUYBRUSH
Er.

{scared}[to himself] The Pox of LeChuck...

{confused}The Pox of LeChuck?  [mulling it over] Hmm..  Pox of LeChuck... {sarcastic}nah!  {Stern}To on-the-nose, {surprised}not enough pizzazz!  {enthused}"Death Cloud" is punchier, more in-your-face, more "ooh, I'm gonna die!"  {default}Well, I got sick pirates to interview! {enthused} See ya!
1135)  GUYBRUSH
Y'know, there's other sick pirates infected with the same disease as my hand.  Why don't you cut off their limbs?
1136)  DESINGE
{happy}Oh I have... {default}but your case is special somehow!  {amazed}I must have that hand!
1137)  GUYBRUSH

Whatta fight!  That was spectacular, Driftwood!  Best pirate brouhaha I've seen in months!
1147)  GUYBRUSH
I don't know what got in to me... it was like my hand was possessed or something.
1148)  NIPPERKIN
Possessed you say?  Hmmm.  Sounds like there may be a follow-up story there.
1149)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy}Keep feeding me these boffo pirate stories, Threepwood, and {Suspicious} I'll be handing over the secrets of Deep Gut before you know it!

1155)  ROCKRIB
Your MEMBERSHIP card, mate.
1156)  GUYBRUSH
I, um, left it in my other pants.

Card?
1158)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} Card?  {Happy} Oh yes, my membership card.  {Default} Here ya go.
1159)  ROCKRIB
Very good, Captain Van Winslow.  Here's your blindfold.
1160)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} [confused]Blindfold?
1161)  ROCKRIB
Come now, sir, you know the rules.  All Probationary Club 41 Members must wear blindfolds inside the Club.

Wait, stop!  I must have your beautiful, death-defying hand!  Come ba-

<mmmph!> [angry] Slovenly pirates, leaving their trash floating all over the place!
1166)  DESINGE
[scheming] Hmmm.  A pirate hunter, eh?
1167)  GUYBRUSH
If this "Morgan Le Flay - Pirate Hunter" is half as nasty as his ads, I'd better give him a wide berth.

1173)  PIRATEA
{Angry} Are you outta your grog-addled mind?!? No!
1174)  PIRATEA
{Stern} Arrr, that doesn't sound too manly! Any girly pirate can loot a defenseless fishing community.
1175)  PIRATEA
{Happy}The better to insult arm wrestle with Mr. Threepwood!
1176)  PIRATEA
{Default} Well nowadays you can't throw a dart or...or play a game of checkers without bein' expected to toss in a witherin' bon mot.
1177)  PIRATEA
{Sad} A greedy Australian is making a grab for my bar!
1178)  PIRATEA
{Enthused} My particular speciality is insult arm-wrestlin' {Default} which I use to defend my bar {Stern}from hostile takeovers.
1179)  PIRATEA
Aye! {Sarcastic}It could be a pleasure to sail with a refined wit such as yourself.
1180)  PIRATEB
{Default} Right now, we're in a dead tie.
1181)  PIRATEB
{Happy} Yeah! We never miss a shot!
1182)  PIRATEB
{Default} I would, but once I win the Melee championship, I'm gonna have to go on tour to win the tri-island dart thrower's championship.
1183)  PIRATEB
No Problem!
1184)  PIRATEB
{Sarcastic} Yeah! And unless you're good enough to compete
1185)  PIRATEB
{Stern} We'd advise that you take a long walk off a short pier!

{Default} Not really, but-
1193)  NIPPERKIN
{Enthused} Great!  {Default} Now if you'll excuse me, {Cocky} Ace Reporter Davey Nipperkin's got some headlines to grab!
1194)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm, seems simple enough.
1195)  GUYBRUSH
I think Pierre's Pajamas are black enough as it is.
1196)  
You don't look so good.
1197)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} No!
1198)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} Aye!  But I {Concerned} couldn't figure it out.  I got so frustrated {Stern} that I kicked one of those statues out in the jungle, and {Sad} stubbed me toe.  {Stern} When I went to that butcher De Singe, {Angry} he cut me leg off.

Nipperkin wasn't kidding about news being slow on Flotsam.

1205)  GUYBRUSH
[hushed] Actually, I kinda do, but I don't think it'll help.
1206)  NIPPERKIN
{Suspicious} Trying to sneak some information out of me?  {Default} I can respect that, kid.  Reminds me of {Cocky} me when I was your age.
1207)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} [sarcastic] When was that, about twenty minutes ago?
1208)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Do you really think Deep Gut can tell me what happened to Elaine and LeChuck, and help me get off this island?
1209)  
I've got more questions about those acts of piracy...
1210)  NIPPERKIN
{Default} If there's anyone who can help you with your problems, Skipwood, it's Deep Gut.
1211)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiny} Couldn't you just TELL me how to contact Deep Gut?  {Seductive} I'll be your best friend...
1212)  NIPPERKIN
{Stern} Sorry kid, no can do.  {Default} I need pirate stories, and you need my source.  {Cocky} Any questions?
1213)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm drawing a blank.
1214)  NIPPERKIN
{Stern} I hate it when that happens.
1215)  GUYBRUSH
What can you tell me about this "Morgan Le Flay" guy?
1216)  NIPPERKIN
{Suspicious} The pirate hunter?  {Stern} Oh, he's a mystery, that one. {Stop}
1217)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} How so?
1218)  NIPPERKIN
Stories about Le Flay started trickling in about a year ago.  Frightening, fantastical tales of a hard-as-nails pirate hunter with ice in his veins and death in his eyes.
1219)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Spooky.
1220)  NIPPERKIN
{Sarcastic} Spooky, sure, but none of the stories jibed.  One pirate would testify to a daring escape from a redbearded giant, but the next would spin a yarn about a peg-legged midget.  Either there's a whole fleet of pirate hunters sailin' around callin' themselves "Morgan Le Flay," or someone's hidin' something.
1221)  GUYBRUSH
Know anything about this Le Flay character?
1222)  MCGEE
He's a little after me time, spanky.  But from the whining of some of the younger pirates around here, you'd think he was the devil incarnate!
1223)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} "Ooh, Morgan nailed me head to the deck!"
1224)  MCGEE
{Sarcastic} "Ooh, Le Flay bit off me ear!"
1225)  MCGEE
{Stern} Buncha wussies, the lot of 'em.  In MY day, when a pirate ran into a pirate hunter, we'd sink his ship, keelhaul his crew, and make 'im walk the plank!  In THAT order!
1226)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Whoah!
1227)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}[pointing out the spelling] "Guybrush" is one word...
1228)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}I'd better pick this up before someone notices - {incredulous}um, trips over it.
1229)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}I'm not burning that up!  I might need it... {worried}someday.
1230)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}I'd better not... he might recognize the flowers.
1231)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Know anything about this pirate hunter?
1232)  CRIMPDIGIT
{confused}Le Flay?  {stern}Arrr, you best be steerin' clear o' him, if you know what's good for ya.  They way I hears it, his face is so hideously grotesque that most pirates slit their own throats at the mere sight of him!
1233)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[incredulous] Right.
1234)  CRIMPDIGIT
{worried}No, really.  I heard it... from a friend of a guy.
1235)  GUYBRUSH
[incredulous] A friend of a guy who slit his throat...
1236)  CRIMPDIGIT
Aye!
1237)  GUYBRUSH
[slightly loudly]  Hey!  Do you know anything about this Le Flay guy?
1238)  WINSLOW
{confused}[slightly loudly]  Morgan Le Flay?  Beastly chap!  Keeps a nest of trained scorpions in his beard, or so the story goes.

Scorpions, eh?  I should try that the next time Elaine complains about crumbs in my beard.
1240)  GUYBRUSH

{Stern} Threepwood!
1244)  DESINGE
[annoyed] {Arrogant} Well played, Mr. Threepwood. You have forced me to reveal the location of the hidden temple. {Sarcastic} But a simpleton like you will never be able to master the mysteries of {Arrogant} this ancient wind control device without my help, and I will reveal NOTH--
1245)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} That's a wind control device?  {Happy} Thanks for telling me!
1246)  DESINGE
[angry, frustrated with himself for revealing more than he should of] {Worried} You... didn't... know? {Angry}  Arrrrrrgh!
1247)  GUYBRUSH
According to De Singe, this ancient doohickey controls the winds on Flotsam Island... somehow.

1251)  GUYBRUSH
{Scared} Something about that shack shivers me timbers...
1252)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} Somehow, the knowledge that the Voodoo Lady's in there hasn't made this shack any less timber-shivering.
1253)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} Aw, dang.  Looks like someone already dug up this treasure.
1254)  GUYBRUSH
I hope no one notices that I've re-gifted this buried treasure spot.
1255)  GUYBRUSH
That's a good idea, but I don't think D'Oro'd be interested in digging up ANOTHER Pink Pajamas Pierre.
1256)  GUYBRUSH
I'll just bury...
1257)  GUYBRUSH
Wait, I can't bury this yet!  It doesn't have its "Killer Katana Kutlass" accessory!
1258)  GUYBRUSH
[whispering] Dark Ninja Dave with Killer Katana Kutlass waits stealthily for famed out-of-shape pirate hunter Joaquin D'oro to find him...
1259)  GUYBRUSH
I don't want to bury that.
1260)  GUYBRUSH
{Sarcastic} Hm.  Looks like I cut off the door's nose to spite its face.
1261)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, not a bad fit.
1262)  GUYBRUSH
That's not a GOUDA idea. I don't know JACK about this MUENSTER, and if it b-ROQUEFORT we'd be BLEU and okay I'll stop now.
1263)  GUYBRUSH
Would you like a flower?
1264)  DORO
No thanks.  Flowers give me hives.
1265)  GUYBRUSH
There's no place to put it.
1266)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Hmmm.
1267)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Much better.  {Suspicious} Well, better, anyway.

1279)  GUYBRUSH
This idol looks like it's missing something.
1280)  GUYBRUSH
I don't know much about ancient idols, but this one looks really broken.
1281)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I've just had a really weird idea.
1282)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I've got a mission for you, little parrot!  Go to the other side of this door, {Incredulous} and open it from the other side!
1283)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Okay, little champion!  Open the door!
1284)  GUYBRUSH
{Seductive} And yet, there's still something downright charming about him.
1285)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uh-oh!
1286)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} Ah, so it appears that Monsieur Threepwood HAS found the Vaycaylian Porte du Vent! {Stern}  Naughty little pirate boy!
1287)  DESINGE
{Sarcastic} Come out, come out, wherever you are, Monsieur Threepwood!
1288)  DESINGE
{Arrogant} Really, monsieur, how many times must we repeat this pointless charade?
1289)  DESINGE
Hello, is anybody in there?
1290)  DESINGE
[snooty] {Confused} Hmph.  How silly of me. {Arrogant} Threepwood would never be clever enough to get through that door.
1291)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I am TOO clever enough to get through that door! {Incredulous} Or at least, make him THINK I am.
1292)  DESINGE
Yoo-hoo?  Anyone?...
1293)  DESINGE
{Stern} Hmph.  I see no evidence that anyone's been on the other side of that door!
1294)  DESINGE
Is anybody in there?
1295)  PARROT
[muffled] <squawk> It's me, Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate!
1296)  DESINGE
[flummoxed] {Confused} What?  How'd he-?
1297)  DESINGE
{Angry} Grrr.
1298)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I can't believe he fell for that.
1299)  GUYBRUSH
This looks like it might be useful.
1300)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Who's the cleverest pirate in the whole wide world?
1301)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] {Sarcastic} Can I call you "D'Oro the Explorer?"
1302)  DORO
{Stern} No.
1303)  GUYBRUSH
Know anything about this pirate hunter?
1304)  DORO
Morgan Le Flay!?  Only that he's the coolest privateer ever!  They say his suspenders are made from the severed hooks of his pirate prey!
1305)  GUYBRUSH
[incredulous] How's THAT supposed to work?
1306)  DORO
I don't know, but isn't it cool!?
1307)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Can you make heads or tails out of this thing?{default}
1308)  VOODOO
Unless these old eyes deceive me, that is an all-purpose Vaycaylian Al'n [pronounced "ah-LEN"] Wrench, used to activate their elaborate machines.
1309)  
Can you help me get off Flotsam Island?
1310)  
That cutlass recipe you gave me was a dud!
1311)  
I followed your recipe to the letter, but Elaine messed it up!
1312)  
I kinda had to ad-lib your cutlass recipe...
1313)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Where can I find it?
1314)  
Can you help me get off Flotsam Island?
1315)  
How do I stave off the Pox of LeChuck?
1316)  
The Pox of LeChuck is spreading!
1317)  
About this "Big Sponge..."
1318)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}If you can't tell me about Elaine, can you at least tell me where LeChuck is?
1319)  VOODOO
Without the mark of the voodoo on him, LeChuck's whereabouts are a mystery to me.
1320)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Well, this has been disturbing, but I've got an island to escape, a wife to find and, {suspicious}apparently, a giant voodoo-sucking sponge to hunt.
1321)  VOODOO
May the Fates guide you, Guybrush Threepwood.
1322)  GUYBRUSH
{cocky}Don't get up, I'll find my own way out.
1323)  VOODOO
Be well, Threepwood.
1324)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Y'know, you've been helping me out for years, and I still don't know you name!
1325)  VOODOO
{stern}Names have power, Guybrush Threepwood.  Only a fool willingly gives it away.
1326)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Does MY name have power?
1327)  VOODOO
{default}Er, um, sure.  Why not?
1328)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}How'd you end up on Flotsam Island?
1329)  VOODOO
I go where I am needed.
1330)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}So YOU'RE "Deep Gut?"  Davey Nipperkin's source of off-island news?
1331)  VOODOO
Yes.
1332)  GUYBRUSH
Why?
1333)  VOODOO
The price of a voodoo lifestyle is not merely spiritual, little pirate.  It also requires a substantial financial commitment.
1334)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Have you ever heard of this pirate hunter?
1335)  VOODOO
{mystical}Hmm, this "Morgan" is unknown to me.  But...{entranced} [the Voodoo Lady's eyes roll back] [she begins intoning lines Morgan will say in future episodes] Guybrush Threepwood!... There's no escape... The skull is right... You!... Arrrrrrrgh!{mystical} [her eyes return to normal]
1336)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What was that?{default}
1337)  VOODOO
The past?  The future?  Who can say?{default}
1338)  WINSLOW
{enthused}Welcome aboard, sir!
1339)  GUYBRUSH
Van Winslow!  What are you doing here?
1340)  WINSLOW
{default}If it's all right with you, captain, I'd like to stay aboard as your first mate!
1341)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}I don't know...
1342)  
I really don't want a first mate who'll be trying to seize my ship...
1343)  
I really don't want a first mate with major internal injuries...
1344)  
I really don't want a first mate at ALL... I'm a bit of a loner...
1345)  
I really don't want a first mate who hasn't sailed in two years...
1346)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}I really don't-
1347)  WINSLOW
{happy}[interupting] Jolly good, sir!  You won't regret it, mark my words!  Now, if you'll excuse me, I believe some of my stitches have popped.  I'll meet you here if the winds ever change!
1348)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[loudly] Van Winslow!   Where are you!?
1349)  WINSLOW
{enthused}[loudly] Right here, sir!
1350)  GUYBRUSH
[loudly]Raise anchor and get us the heck out of here before the winds change!
1351)  WINSLOW
[loudly] With pleasure, captain!
1352)  
Set sail for the Rock of Gelato, so I can find Elaine!
1353)  
Set sail for the Rock of Gelato, so I can finish off LeChuck!
1354)  
Set sail for the Rock of Gelato, so I can work on my tan!
1355)  WINSLOW
{enthused}Congratulations, sir!  The Screaming Narwhal has successfully escaped from Flotsam Island!  Where to now?
1356)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Mister Van Winslow...
1357)  GUYBRUSH
If you would be so kind...
1358)  GUYBRUSH
I would like you to set sail for [hand clamped over mouth] mrph-mrph mprh mr rph mrph!
1359)  WINSLOW
{confused}Come again, sir?
1360)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1][read with urgency][panicy and angry]{angry}I SAID set a course for [hand clamped over mouth] mrph-mrph mprh mr rph mrph!
1361)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1][read with urgency][angry and loud]Oh, come on!
1362)  WINSLOW
{concerned}Come on what sir?
1363)  GUYBRUSH
Winslow! [trying to speak quickly]  Setacoursefor [hand covers mouth] mpphmphmphmph-mph!
1364)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Okay, let's break some bottles!
1365)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Hey!  Knock it off, hand!
1366)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Ow!
1367)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Looks like I'm gonna have to get my hand under control if I want to break this bottle.
1368)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Hey!
1369)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Ow!
1370)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} Nope.
1371)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think it would look good there.
1372)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I'm not giving this away!  It could pay for my kid's pirate school someday!
1373)  GUYBRUSH
That's not made of "unbreakable" glass.
1374)  GUYBRUSH
That's cheesy enough as it is.
1375)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} If I start giving away my cheese, I could end up cheeseless!  {Incredulous} Then were would I be?
1376)  GUYBRUSH
Nah.
1377)  GUYBRUSH
Nope.
1378)  GUYBRUSH
Um, no.
1379)  GUYBRUSH
Um, I don't want to part with this right now.
1380)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I don't think a flower sconce would enhance the feng shui right here.
1381)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} That really doesn't need skewering by a teeny tiny sword.
1382)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} Waving around my tiny little sword at people could get me in trouble.
1383)  GUYBRUSH
The only person I should give this to is Coronado De Cava... and that's not him.
1384)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[loudly, speaking between ships][trying to think up something clever to say] Yeah, well, you fight like a-
1385)  GUYBRUSH
{default}[loudly, speaking between ships] I'm on it!  {cocky}One LeChuck-defeating Cursed Cutlass of Kaflu, coming up!
1386)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Now where did I leave those handy voodoo instructions?
1387)  ELAINE
{surprised}What are you doing?  {angry}Finish him!
1388)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}It's not me, it's my hand!  It won't--

{disgust}[quick and disgusted]  Ew.
1391)  NIPPERKIN
{default}- Why don't you take a walk with me back to the Keelhauler and tell me a little bit more about yourself...
1392)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Stupid bird.
1393)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Hey, there's something in this sock!
1394)  GUYBRUSH
{Proud} I wish I were the mightiest pirate ever!
1395)  LECHUCKDEMON
{Default} Arrr!  No!
1396)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Yipes.
1397)  GUYBRUSH
I wonder what sort of hideous sacrificial rites were performed on this ancient altar?
1398)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, tastes like chicken.
1399)  GUYBRUSH
I don't want to sacrifice that.
1400)  GUYBRUSH
That could pollute the Flotsam water supply... and not in a good and/or funny way.
1401)  GUYBRUSH
Hmm, according to this, it's Sunday, the 12th of Manatee.
1402)  MCGEEBAR
Me cat!
1403)  MEMBER2
Me nachos!

Me eye!

{disgust}Muenster, yick!  {suspicious}Still, maybe I'll find some starving rats who'll eat it.
1408)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm.
1409)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Take THIS, "unbreakable" bottle!
1410)  GUYBRUSH
Hey, look out!
1411)  GUYBRUSH
{sarcastic}Well, at least the bottle's probably broken.
1412)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}[shouting]Right! On it, Honeybunch!  {default}I was just finishing up some things...
1413)  ELAINE
{surprised}[shouting]GUYBRUSH! Focus!  {stern}Piece of paper!  Stuck to the mast!  {bitchy}It's the big giant stick in the center of your ship!{default}
1414)  GUYBRUSH
There'll be plenty of time for frolicking in the ship's hold later.
1415)  GUYBRUSH
That's a good idea... but I should probably try lighting it first.
1416)  GUYBRUSH
That hurt.
1417)  GUYBRUSH
{scared}Darn
1418)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Ow.
1419)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}Drat.
1420)  GUYBRUSH
{default}I should probably come up with a plan before lighting another one of those.
1421)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}Wow.  I never thought I'd ever see a pirate selling glass unicorns for a living.
1422)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Aye, and I never thought I'd see a talking baboon, so I guess we're even.
1423)  ELAINE
{stern}[shouting]Hurry up with that recipe already!

1426)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "Alphabet Sale - Free Vowels While Supplies Last!"
1427)  GUYBRUSH
{surprised}Hmm, I guess it IS unbreakable.

I hope the Marquis doesn't mind that I've broken the face off his ancient manatee door thingie.

1438)  WINSLOW
Hmm, still not dry...
1439)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Hmm, shouldn't there be some sort of glowy voodoo explosion here?  {default}Maybe the grog just isn't root beery enough?
1440)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1]{default}Any way you slice it, that barrel of grog still isn't root beer.  {cocky}I've got to get to the root of this problem!{default}

Hmph.  You'd think a classy joint like this would have a RED carpet.
1508)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}I hope those knives are securely attached to the wall.  If I keep shocking the monkey by them,{surprised} I may end up with a shish-ka-baboon.{default}

{confused}What's this?{default}
1512)  VOODOO
{mystical}Ah, the spirits have guided you well.  {default}That is a bottle containing an ancient scroll left behind by the Vaycaylians, the former inhabitants of Flotsam Island.
1513)  GUYBRUSH
{default}Ancient scroll, eh?  Do you think it can tell me anything about these messed-up winds?
1514)  VOODOO
{mystical}Perhaps.  But first you'll have to figure out how to break the unbreakable bottle I've sealed it in.{default}
1515)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Unbreakable bottle?  Why would you do that?{default}
1516)  VOODOO
{stern}Some secrets are too dangerous to fall into mortal hands, Threepwood.{default}
1517)  GUYBRUSH
Anything else you want to tell me about this scroll-in-a-bottle?

I procured the scroll from a bitter old pirate named McGee.  Make of that what you will.

{default}Wait!
1520)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}What?
1521)  VOODOO
{mystical}Perhaps I CAN help you escape from Flotsam Island.

How?{default}

{Whiney}I haven't got a crew to take me to Lucre Island.
1524)  GUYBRUSH

{Happy} Keen!  {Seductive} Can I borrow it?
1527)  MCGEE
{Default} Now why in the {Stern} name of Neptune's hangnails would I let you borrow this priceless artifact of a long-dead civilization?
1528)  GUYBRUSH
McGee says this thing's the key to his scroll... of course, McGee also drinks a lot.
1529)  GUYBRUSH
It's... empty?
1530)  GUYBRUSH
Still empty.
1531)  GUYBRUSH
This looks promising...
1532)  GUYBRUSH
I don't need to see that in manatee-vision.
1533)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} No way!  {Stern} If I give this to him, HE'LL get first pick of all the fine pirate honies that I'VE picked out... {Embarrassed} for, um, my friend.
1534)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} No way I'm giving this away after all the trouble I went through to get it!
1535)  GUYBRUSH
I think this thing only works on ancient Flotsam artifacts.
1536)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} I don't want to blow that up!
1537)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} C'mon bomby!
1538)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Ow.
1539)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Dang.
1540)  GUYBRUSH
Let 'em get their OWN flier.
1541)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} That'd make a lousy perch.
1542)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} I don't think they'd enjoy my parrot as much as I do. {Worried}
1543)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I don't think that a U-Tube would be useful there.
1544)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} I don't think they'd be amused by my U-Tube offering.
1545)  NIPPERKIN
{Sarcastic} Yeah.  {Default} Off-island news is nice and all, but the fair citizens of Flotsam are getting tired of stories about {Stern} faraway lands that they'll never see again.  {Suspicious} Not to mention that I hate being beholden to this Deep Gut person.
1546)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} So?
1547)  NIPPERKIN
{Enthused} So I need some nice meaty local pirate news!
1548)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Won't using a pirate treasure hunter to find a treasure {Confused} kind of mess up the story?
1549)  NIPPERKIN
{Default} Nah.  If anything, {Suspicious} it'll make it more authentic.  I can see it now - [frames a headline] {Enthused} "NEW ARRRIVAL HELPS FAMED PIRATE TREASURE HUNTER BAG BIGGEST BOOTY EVER!"
1550)  GUYBRUSH
Do you know anything about breaking unbreakable bottles?
1551)  MCGEE
Unbreakable - [angry, going pox] {Angry} What in hell's hand basket makes you think I'd know anything about bottle blowin'!?
1552)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Touchy.
1553)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Even if this wasn't an unbreakable bottle, I don't think that's hard enough to break it.
1554)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}[ceremoniously] I christen thee, "Threepwood's Cool New Ship."
1555)  GUYBRUSH
{whiney}It was worth a shot.
1556)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}[winded]  Impressive.
1557)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Don't get cute, blondie.  [threatening] I break other things, too, ya know.
1558)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "The doctor is BUSY"
1559)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "The doctor is IN"
1560)  GUYBRUSH
[reading] "The doctor is OUT"
1561)  GUYBRUSH
No way.  The way my luck's running the fire'd probably torch the scroll long before it broke open the bottle.
1562)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Er, really weird puppet shows?
1563)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} What makes Dark Ninja Dave so rare?
1564)  DORO
{Default} Because a bunch of {Stern} pirate parents had him banned on account of his {Cocky} pointy Killer Karate Katana accessory.  {Sarcastic} They said it was a choking hazard.  {Stern} Wimps.
1565)  GUYBRUSH
[acting] {Confused} Foolish Power Pirate!  Your porcelain parts will be sacrificed {Suspicious} to, um, Bob,{Sarcastic} the Lord of the Seas!
1566)  GUYBRUSH
[high-pitched, as though coming from the action figure] {Worried} Arrrr!  Me kidneys!
1567)  GUYBRUSH
Huh?
1568)  GUYBRUSH
{stern}[loudly] I was told there would be no math!
1569)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}[too himself] So all I have to do is knock him off, eh?
1570)  GUYBRUSH
Want your map back?
1571)  DORO
Does it lead to a treasure?
1572)  GUYBRUSH
Um...not yet?
1573)  DORO
Then I don't want anything to do with it.
1574)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Great news, D'Oro!  I think your map isn't a rip-off after all!
1575)  DORO
{Confused} It isn't? {Default}  But I never found anything with it!
1576)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} You must've been reading it wrong.  Here, follow me...
1577)  GUYBRUSH
[awestruck]{Surprised} Whoah.
1578)  GUYBRUSH
{Worried} Uh-oh, someone's coming.
1579)  DESINGE
{Worried} Whew!  {Arrogant} I never thought I'd have to come out here again!
1580)  DESINGE
But it'll be worth a temporary fluctuation in Flotsam's winds to get my hands on Threepwood's... {Sarcastic} hand.  Heh
1581)  DESINGE
[amused, to himself] {Happy} "Hands on his hand..." how droll.
1582)  GUYBRUSH
{Confused} What was that all about?  {Suspicious} And what's behind that door?
1583)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious} Hey, I bet if I throw this thing over the door, I can fool passers-by {Happy} into thinking I'm on the other side!
1584)  GUYBRUSH
Does this look familiar?
1585)  DESINGE
{amazed}[nervious] Where'd you find that?
1586)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}It, um, fell off that creepy ancient door in the jungle.
1587)  DESINGE
[lying badly]  An ancient door with a manatee head in the jungle?  {stern}I have no idea what you're talking about!
1588)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}[nonchalant]  Sure, sure. {default} But you might want to check it out someday.  Looks like it could be pretty interesting, scientifically speaking.{proud} I'm heading back there now, to break through the door with my pirate-y wiles...
1589)  GUYBRUSH
[to himself]  {stern}First, I'll need some dynamite, then a rubber chicken with a pulley in the middle, then some sort of rudimentary lathe...
1590)  DESINGE
{angry}[fuming] Hmph.  He'll never open that door without my key. {default} Still, I'd better follow him from a safe distance, just to make sure he doesn't upset my long-term plans...
1591)  GUYBRUSH
Now that the door's open, I really don't want to close it again.
1592)  GUYBRUSH
Uh-uh.
1593)  GUYBRUSH
I don't think so.
1594)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} Darn, I've broken the U-Tube. {Stop} I better get another.
1595)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Me?  Steal something?  I wouldn't even know where-{scared} [excited]Hey, look!  A three-headed monkey!
1596)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Hey!
1597)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}[innocent] What?
1598)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}[excited]Hey look, a tungsten-flanged blowpipe!
1599)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Stop trying to steal me bottle breaker!
1600)  GUYBRUSH
Treasure, wow!
1601)  GUYBRUSH
Yay, more booty!
1602)  GUYBRUSH
I love the smell of treasure in the morning...
1603)  GUYBRUSH
[happy] Arrrrr!

1612)  VOODOO
{default}Why do you tarry, Threepwood?  {mystical}Your destiny lies elsewhere!{default}
1613)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}Wow, he seems excited about something.{default}
1614)  JACQUES
[excited] Eek-eek-eek!
1615)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} I'd better be careful around this ink.  I don't want to become Guybrush Threepwood, Spotty Pirate.
1616)  GUYBRUSH
{Embarrassed} You know, if someone caught me walking around with a pink doll, it'd be a real black mark on my record.
1617)  GUYBRUSH
Why can't anyone just make a straightforward map... Someone around here must know how this thing works.
1618)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} It's hard to have a short fuse with someone as friendly as Winslow, but I really want on that boat!
1619)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} There has to be another way onto that ship; something a little more piratey...
1620)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} Maybe I'm overthinking how to get onto the boat....
1621)  GUYBRUSH
{confused}[loudly]Are you sure you don't know where your Membership Card is?
1622)  WINSLOW
{cocky}[loudly]Well there was quite a soiree after I seized the Narwhal!  I'm still cleaning up the grog stains!
1623)  DORO
{Sarcastic} Finally, the full set of Porcelain {Enthused} Power Pirates is mine, all mine!
1624)  GUYBRUSH
{happy}Like a toilet!{default}
1625)  VOODOO
Sure, why not.
1626)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney} It's locked.
1627)  NIPPERKIN
No one allowed in there but Keelhauler employees, Leapwood.  You thinking of becoming a reporter?
1628)  GUYBRUSH
{Surprised} Oh, heck no.
1629)  GUYBRUSH
It's locked.
1630)  NIPPERKIN
{Confused} What're you doing here?  Shouldn't you be off looking for Deep Gut?
1631)  GUYBRUSH
Bye.
1632)  NIPPERKIN
{Happy} Keep up the pirating, kid!  I'm rootin' for ya.
1633)  GUYBRUSH
{Default} Davey.
1634)  NIPPERKIN
{Sarcastic} Whaddaya got for me, Sleepgood?
1635)  NIPPERKIN
(sigh).

1647)  MCGEE
[grouchy] {Stern} Whattaya want now?
1648)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} So long.
1649)  MCGEE
[incoherently] {Stern} Yeah, whatever...
1650)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} Thanks, Hemlock!  I promise you {Seductive} probably won't regret this!
1651)  GUYBRUSH
I know you're supposed to stop and smell the flowers, but this pot looks like someone's taken it a wee bit too literally.
1652)  GUYBRUSH
I didn't think it was possible, but this idol's cheesier than ever!
1653)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} I need to turn the tables on De Singe!
1654)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} I'd like to turn that gun on De Singe... see how he likes it!
1655)  GUYBRUSH
This poor idol has a wheel-shaped hole where its eyes should be.
1656)  GUYBRUSH
[sneezing] Ah-choo!
1657)  GUYBRUSH
I better not be allergic to one of these plants...
1658)  GUYBRUSH
That's a spectacularly good idea, but I don't think the eyes I'm looking for are on this idol.
1659)  GUYBRUSH
{incredulous}So. Unicorns huh?
1660)  CRIMPDIGIT
{happy}Aye, graceful, delicate creatures they are.  {suspicious}Though to be honest they aren't selling so well to the pirate community at large. {default} For my next project, maybe I'll make something that really speaks to them.  {angry}[angry]Assuming I can ever sell these blasted horny buggers!
1661)  GUYBRUSH
Hmmm, where have I seen those faces before?
1662)  VOODOO
{Surprised} You Pulled?
1663)  VOODOO
{Mystical} Yes, it is I.
1664)  VOODOO
My name is...{Stern}not important.
1665)  VOODOO
{Entranced} I sense that you wish to dabble in the dangerous voodoo arts. What did you have in mind?
1666)  VOODOO
Sigh
1667)  VOODOO
{Stern}Sorry, we're fresh out. We're expecting a {Default} shipment from Dinky Island early next week, though.
1668)  VOODOO
{Mystical} But I sensed that I was needed here on Melee. {Stern}Besides, the incessant clucking on Puerto Pollo {Angry} was driving me mad!
1669)  VOODOO
{Mystical} Who can say? Perhaps it's because we share an unspoken magical bond. Perhaps the fates have intertwined our destinies. {Happy} Or maybe I've got an unbreakable five-game deal with Lucasarts. {Default} In any event, I'm here to help. How can I assist you, Guybrush Threepwood?
1670)  VOODOO
That is an excellent question, Guybrush.
1671)  VOODOO
{Default}What goes up, must come down. But what's more important {Mystical} is WHERE it comes down.
1672)  VOODOO
The cards have foretold that you seek direction.
1673)  VOODOO
{Stern} In any event, the few pirates remaining on Melee Island, live in constant fear of being challenged by this foreign investor.
1674)  VOODOO
{Default}You don't need a sword to send your foes into a stupor, my child, just be yourself.
1675)  VOODOO
{Default}As you wish, Guybrush. {Mystical}I'll be here later if you need me.
1676)  VOODOO
{Stern} This is a pirate town. {Default} Even in these economically depressed times you should be able to find a couple of competent sailors.
1677)  DESINGE
{happy}[cheery] Bon jour!
1678)  GUYBRUSH
Hi there.  {confused}Are you a doctor?
1679)  DESINGE
[cheery] Mais oui!  I am the Marquis De Singe [pronounced "sahnj"], former court physician to King Louis himself!  {default}And who might you be?
1680)  GUYBRUSH
{proud}Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate™!
1681)  DESINGE
{amazed}Zut alors!  Your hand!
1682)  GUYBRUSH
{embarrassed}[sheepish] Yeah, I seem to have come down with something...
1683)  DESINGE
This is fantastic!  We must investigate this at once!
1684)  GUYBRUSH
{Cocky} Idol hands are the devil's something something...
1685)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I could go for a good grog right now... or even a bad one.
1686)  GUYBRUSH
{Incredulous} I wonder if there's anything in the Voodoo Lady's that can help me...
1687)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I can't wait to take my new ship out for a spin!
1688)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I hope the Narwhal's ready to sail...
1689)  GUYBRUSH
[sneezing] Ah-choo!
1690)  GUYBRUSH
{Suspicious} If I ever want to find a treasure, I bet I'm going to have to leave town.
1691)  GUYBRUSH
{Happy} I feel the urge to do some exploring.
1692)  GUYBRUSH
{Stern} This jungle is starting to drive me nuts...
1693)  GUYBRUSH
I'm so sorry.
1694)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}A "U"?  What about A, E, I, O,{worried} or even Y?
1695)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}All sold out.  All we got is U Tubes these days.
1696)  GUYBRUSH
I'll take another one of your U Tubes, please.
1697)  CRIMPDIGIT
{confused}What happened to the last one?
1698)  GUYBRUSH
{worried}I, um, lost it.
1699)  CRIMPDIGIT
{stern}Here ya go... lucky for you no else seems all that interested in me U Tube offerings...
1700)  GUYBRUSH
{Whiney}I haven't got a crew to take me to Lucre Island.
1701)  GUYBRUSH
{suspicious}Oh what a relief it isn't!  {default}This stuff is like root beer, but without the usual stimulating fizz.

I think it's some sort of blood sacrifice in exchange for the secret language of the dead.  {Sarcastic} Or maybe he just really hates monkeys. {Dismissive} It's all been a little vague.

2079)  
Deep in the Caribbean, the evil undead pirate LeChuck is moments from completing a dark voodoo spell giving him powers untold.  Our hero, Guybrush Threepwood, plans to stop him by using his own mystical voodoo instructions to enchant his cutlass and skewer the villain.
2080)  
Guybrush found the necessary root beer (don't ask where), and resourcefully used his fizzy breath mints to give it some kick.
2081)  
But just as he was about to spray the fizzy root beer on the cutlass, LeChuck evilly rammed his ship, and Guybrush's root beer became a casualty of war.  Guybrush realized he needed a replacement, and quick!
2082)  
Guybrush washed up on the shore of Flotsam Island with a voodoo-infected hand and his beautiful wife, Elaine, nowhere in sight.  He was greeted by ace reporter Davey Nipperkin, who spoke of the one person who could help him get off the island: Deep Gut.  Nipperkin agreed to reveal the location of Deep Gut if Guybrush created some exciting pirate news, so Guybrush got to work.
2083)  
He walked in to Club 41 and started the worst bar brawl in Flotsam's history (blindfolded no less), although most of the credit belonged to his icky hand.
2084)  
He bombed his way aboard the Screaming Narwhal, seizing it from the preternaturally pleasant Reginald Van Winslow.
2085)  
He not only buried a treasure, but helped professional treasure hunter Joaquin D'Oro dig it back up again.
2086)  
True to his word, Nipperkin revealed the location of Deep Gut, and Guybrush set out to find some answers.
2087)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Ugh.  This one looks like it's missing a nose...
2088)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Seriously, who goes around ripping the noses off of ancient idols?
2089)  
Deep Gut turned out to be the ever mysterious Voodoo Lady, who revealed that to leave Flotsam, Guybrush would have to reverse the island's unnatural winds.  Not knowing the source of the winds, our hero found a single clue to help him in his quest:  an unbreakable bottle containing a map.  Guybrush set out to break the unbreakable.
2090)  
But before he could deal with the bottle, Guybrush visited the Marquis de Singe to sedate his voodoo-infected hand.  The Marquis, however, decided he wanted the hand for himself!
2091)  
Luckily, Guybrush was able to make his escape before the Marquis could use his petite guillotine.
2092)  
Guybrush returned to the task of opening the bottle using Gaffer Crimpdigit's bottle-breaker.  Inside was an enigmatic map, seemingly completely blank.
2093)  
But with Hemlock McGee's Eye of the Manatee, Guybrush was able to reveal the map leading to the source of the winds.
2094)  
Still hoping to get off Flotsam by reversing the island's unnatural winds, Guybrush followed Hemlock's map to their source.  There Guybrush discovered none other than the Marquis de Singe leaving from an ancient stone door, carrying the key that Guybrush needed to get inside.
2095)  
With the help of a tiny stunt double, Guybrush succeeded in tricking the Marquis to open the door.  On the other side he discovered the source of the winds:  a giant sucking machine.
2096)  
Using the Marquis' key, Guybrush revealed four stone idols around the jungle, and realized that each one must play a part in turning the winds.
2097)  
Guybrush finally managed to reverse Flotsam's winds, allowing him to set sail for Elaine.  His hand, however, has other plans... or maybe it's just being a jerk.
2098)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1]  Hm.  That's one inviting socket.  I hope whatever's supposed to be stuck into that socket will help me figure out how to manage this wind control machinery.
2099)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1]  That's a socket for the ancient weather vane.
2100)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] The faces on those idols look familiar...
2101)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I wonder if the winds gods on the idols are related to the ones on the weather vane...
2102)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1]  That jungle sure is noisy.
2103)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Sure are a lot of animals on this map.
2104)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I wonder if the animals in Flotsam's jungles can help me with this thing...
2105)  GUYBRUSH
I wonder who can help me with this worthless map?
2106)  GUYBRUSH
Eye'd better keep my EYE on this map.  Ayyye.
2107)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Ancient map, ancient map... what else do I have that's ancient?
2108)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Looks like I have to do... something... at the altar, the well, and the calendar to solve this map.
2109)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1]  Are those drawings supposed to represent the wind?
2110)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1]So far so good.
2111)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I wonder who might know something about blowing exotic unbreakable bottles?
2112)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I really should make sure my new ship is ship-shape before shipping out...

[pickup1][ annoyed] {Arrogant} Well played, Mr. Threepwood. You have forced me to reveal the location of the hidden temple. {Sarcastic} But without my help, a simpleton like you will never be able to figure out which of the so-called "wind gods" must be summoned to master {Arrogant} this ancient wind control device, and I will reveal NOTHING![he is cut off]
2138)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] {Suspicious} Hmm, the winds are still blowing in. {Stern} Looks like I've got some ancient wind gods to summon.
2139)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I wonder if that idol can be used to summon wind gods?
2140)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] If I understood De Singe correctly through his crazy accent, this ancient doohickey will reverse the winds of Flotsam... if I summon the correct wind gods.
2141)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] This idol's way too broken.  I better come back to it later.
2142)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1]  What the-?  This idol doesn't even have an axle!  It'll never work like this!
2143)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I generally don't rub my booty in the faces of those I've stolen it from.
2144)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] As happy as it'd make D'Oro to finally get his hands on a Dark Ninja Dave (or an unreasonable facsimile), I think it'd be a lot more newsworthy if he found it himself.
2145)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I don't think Nipperkin'll count this as "treasure" unless he sees someone digging it up.
2146)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] [indignant]I'm not putting that poor monkey in a coffin until he's well and truly dead... [sheepish] which, from the looks of things, ought to be in about ten minutes.
2147)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1][read with urgency] Winslow!
2148)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Well I had to sail six of the seven major seas to find the ingredients, but I've finally finished the cutlass.  Almost.
2149)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Now all I need is to find some fizzy root beer to spray on it, and LeChuck's as good as toast... icky, diseased toast.
2150)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Is this thing sloshing?  Four words you don't want to hear when you pick up a coffin.

[pickup1] Looks like I've got some fizzing to do!
2152)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] I sure hope there's some on Elaine's ship, 'cause mine's dry as a bone.  And not one of those wet bones.  I'm talking a dry, dry bone.
2153)  GUYBRUSH
[pickup1] Right!  Have no fear, my love, I shall now heroically find a fizzy root beer substitute!

[pickup1] You can do it, sweetie!
2165)  ELAINE
[pickup1] For the last time, LeChuck, I'm just not that into you!
2166)  ELAINE
[pickup1] Have you no heart, LeChuck?  Wait, what am I saying, of course he doesn't.
2167)  ELAINE
[pickup1] You'll be sorry when my sweet patootie gets his hands on you, LeChuck!
2168)  ELAINE
[pickup1] Won't someone please think of the monkeys!?
2169)  ELAINE
[pickup1][struggling in ropes] These ropes are starting to chafe!
